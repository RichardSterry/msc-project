p284_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p284_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p284_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p284_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p284_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p284_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p284_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p284_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p284_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p284_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p284_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p284_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p284_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p284_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p284_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p284_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p284_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p284_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p284_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p284_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p284_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p284_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p284_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p284_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.
"
p284_025,"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
"
p284_026,"We will be homeless.
"
p284_027,"Is this accurate?
"
p284_028,"I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
"
p284_029,"They have no history.
"
p284_030,"Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
"
p284_031,"I'd just like to play.
"
p284_032,"There's a story, too.
"
p284_033,"This is the window.
"
p284_034,"Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
"
p284_035,"We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
"
p284_036,"Then, suddenly, they weren't.
"
p284_037,"It's a fact.
"
p284_038,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p284_039,"However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
"
p284_040,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p284_041,"Dancing was her life.
"
p284_042,"It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
"
p284_043,"We will push.
"
p284_044,"The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
"
p284_045,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p284_046,"It is marvellous.
"
p284_047,"Every aspect of our play was first class.
"
p284_048,"Our people are ready.
"
p284_049,"Here's a clue.
"
p284_050,"Her body was found about four miles from the car.
"
p284_051,"I was inspired by two things.
"
p284_052,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p284_053,"My fitness was very poor.
"
p284_054,"Sadly, it can't.
"
p284_055,"He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
"
p284_056,"I expect a rapid response.
"
p284_057,"What was the main difference?
"
p284_058,"There's a danger.
"
p284_059,"We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
"
p284_060,"Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
"
p284_061,"George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
"
p284_062,"It's that kind of place.
"
p284_063,"They are real.
"
p284_064,"I've spent a lot of time on buses.
"
p284_065,"Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
"
p284_066,"And if he hadn't become a musician?
"
p284_067,"That was a gold medal for certain.
"
p284_068,"We should have known.
"
p284_069,"Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
"
p284_070,"Robin Williams is very subdued.
"
p284_071,"He was at home with his pals.
"
p284_072,"It was magic.
"
p284_073,"Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
"
p284_074,"The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
"
p284_075,"Is there a new way forward?
"
p284_076,"The party is up for it.
"
p284_077,"Even the one she loved.
"
p284_078,"People must remain vigilant.
"
p284_079,"Today she has been released.
"
p284_080,"Who will pay for this?
"
p284_081,"He had taken everything from me.
"
p284_082,"He seems to be pleased with the picture.
"
p284_083,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p284_084,"They lived for their children.
"
p284_085,"The city council is a major property owner in the area.
"
p284_086,"Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
"
p284_087,"Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
"
p284_088,"It is a lifeline.
"
p284_089,"They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
"
p284_090,"This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
"
p284_091,"She is an expert on medical ethics.
"
p284_092,"That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
"
p284_093,"Then came the crunch.
"
p284_094,"It is annoying.
"
p284_095,"I love the Dome.
"
p284_096,"We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
"
p284_097,"I am extremely sad.
"
p284_098,"It is a love affair.
"
p284_099,"However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
"
p284_100,"May not have been at fault?
"
p284_101,"They tried to deny it.
"
p284_102,"They make a selective perception process.
"
p284_103,"Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
"
p284_104,"That's all right then.
"
p284_105,"Oil embargo endorsed.
"
p284_106,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p284_107,"She reflects a bit.
"
p284_108,"Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
"
p284_109,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p284_110,"It was a funny game.
"
p284_111,"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
"
p284_112,"I was fighting for my life, I thought.
"
p284_113,"It was the eighties.
"
p284_114,"I did not see any reason to change the captain.
"
p284_115,"It is so sad.
"
p284_116,"We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
"
p284_117,"It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
"
p284_118,"Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
"
p284_119,"It is rubbish.
"
p284_120,"That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
"
p284_121,"We enjoyed it today.
"
p284_122,"We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
"
p284_123,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p284_124,"I can't even get into the A team.
"
p284_125,"She really suffered for her art.
"
p284_126,"It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
"
p284_127,"The people will come.
"
p284_128,"No production was achieved.
"
p284_129,"She said she would not welcome the flowers.
"
p284_130,"It plans to return to this field.
"
p284_131,"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
"
p284_132,"Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
"
p284_133,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p284_134,"We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
"
p284_135,"I don't know the full story.
"
p284_136,"It seems so long since I did the exams.
"
p284_137,"And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
"
p284_138,"It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
"
p284_139,"I was awful.
"
p284_140,"The idea is simple.
"
p284_141,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p284_142,"He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
"
p284_143,"It is not just about pay.
"
p284_144,"Note the date.
"
p284_145,"So I got a blood test.
"
p284_146,"The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
"
p284_147,"But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
"
p284_148,"The weather forecast isn't good.
"
p284_149,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p284_150,"The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
"
p284_151,"I was on a roll.
"
p284_152,"She had gone to the Catholic school.
"
p284_153,"We are on a four-year mission.
"
p284_154,"My Dad is a hero.
"
p284_155,"He was asked to quit.
"
p284_156,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p284_157,"He can do no wrong.
"
p284_158,"Was this element always there?
"
p284_159,"These days are long gone.
"
p284_160,"It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
"
p284_161,"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
"
p284_162,"They are not advertised.
"
p284_163,"Seven people were later detained by police.
"
p284_164,"It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
"
p284_165,"Again, we were lucky.
"
p284_166,"They will do their own thing.
"
p284_167,"Does that put pressure on us?
"
p284_168,"One season, they might do well.
"
p284_169,"Is Saddam a threat?
"
p284_170,"As we worked.
"
p284_171,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p284_172,"It is not either national standards or local control.
"
p284_173,"I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
"
p284_174,"I'm just going to hit the shot.
"
p284_175,"Everyone can be bought.
"
p284_176,"Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
"
p284_177,"I've been there.
"
p284_178,"Four policemen were wounded.
"
p284_179,"I saw military vehicles in the distance.
"
p284_180,"The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
"
p284_181,"What has caused the demise of singing?
"
p284_182,"He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
"
p284_183,"Our team is just so young.
"
p284_184,"I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
"
p284_185,"It is a farce.
"
p284_186,"Peace was won.
"
p284_187,"It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
"
p284_188,"I came home by ambulance.
"
p284_189,"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
"
p284_190,"Is that success?
"
p284_191,"They are ready.
"
p284_192,"I have a cold.
"
p284_193,"The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
"
p284_194,"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
"
p284_195,"It's all about money, money, money.
"
p284_196,"There was no safety net.
"
p284_197,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p284_198,"It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
"
p284_199,"After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
"
p284_200,"There was an e-mail.
"
p284_201,"Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
"
p284_202,"I am delighted for Simon.
"
p284_203,"It had all been arranged.
"
p284_204,"It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
"
p284_205,"So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
"
p284_206,"It's not ideal.
"
p284_207,"In each case they were a goal down.
"
p284_208,"However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
"
p284_209,"I might come back.
"
p284_210,"The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
"
p284_211,"The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
"
p284_212,"Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
"
p284_213,"This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
"
p284_214,"At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
"
p284_215,"The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
"
p284_216,"Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
"
p284_217,"It's a question of creating a future awareness.
"
p284_218,"It's not before time.
"
p284_219,"I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
"
p284_220,"The report is due out next month.
"
p284_221,"But she was.
"
p284_222,"Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
"
p284_223,"My wife and family are the support system.
"
p284_224,"The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
"
p284_225,"We were awful.
"
p284_226,"They tried to give her advice.
"
p284_227,"The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
"
p284_228,"The parties have been given until today to respond.
"
p284_229,"There is no excuse.
"
p284_230,"On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
"
p284_231,"But it's a subtle process.
"
p284_232,"The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
"
p284_233,"The car was just there.
"
p284_234,"The whole thing will be great.
"
p284_235,"Our policy is clear.
"
p284_236,"I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
"
p284_237,"You can feel at home in China.
"
p284_238,"The scene is about this?
"
p284_239,"The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
"
p284_240,"It was a kind of contempt.
"
p284_241,"In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
"
p284_242,"Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
"
p284_243,"I should think so, too.
"
p284_244,"It was a hit.
"
p284_245,"There's the mix.
"
p284_246,"There will be widespread support on all sides.
"
p284_247,"Is there on his hands?
"
p284_248,"He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
"
p284_249,"That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
"
p284_250,"However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
"
p284_251,"Chelsea was a great club.
"
p284_252,"It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
"
p284_253,"We have to expand.
"
p284_254,"It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
"
p284_255,"Is that a serious question?
"
p284_256,"They must play for each other.
"
p284_257,"However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
"
p284_258,"There's not much money in cycling.
"
p284_259,"This court has made an order which has not been observed.
"
p284_260,"I am just trying to do my job.
"
p284_261,"This is a question of Islam.
"
p284_262,"Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
"
p284_263,"I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
"
p284_264,"Frankly, we should all have such problems.
"
p284_265,"The system can work.
"
p284_266,"We're in shock.
"
p284_267,"Our objective is to tackle poverty.
"
p284_268,"It's a way of life.
"
p284_269,"She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
"
p284_270,"However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
"
p284_271,"They seem to get away with it.
"
p284_272,"She looked so young.
"
p284_273,"His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
"
p284_274,"Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
"
p284_275,"If not, he should go home.
"
p284_276,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p284_277,"We are a grandmother.
"
p284_278,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p284_279,"You feel very helpless.
"
p284_280,"This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
"
p284_281,"What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
"
p284_282,"He will address the nation this evening.
"
p284_283,"They have shown a great desire and attitude.
"
p284_284,"Maloney is an engaging talent.
"
p284_285,"The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
"
p284_286,"This is a national crisis.
"
p284_287,"Bombing slaughter rejected
"
p284_288,"We are not going to forget.
"
p284_289,"No Briton has ever won.
"
p284_290,"Painful, but only because it's true.
"
p284_291,"He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
"
p284_292,"The songs are just so good.
"
p284_293,"And it's a goodbye from him.
"
p284_294,"The goals will come.
"
p284_295,"Who can predict?
"
p284_296,"If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
"
p284_297,"I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
"
p284_298,"Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
"
p284_299,"I was the sheep.
"
p284_300,"What has altered?
"
p284_301,"Nothing is safe.
"
p284_302,"One was a lawyer.
"
p284_303,"The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
"
p284_304,"A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
"
p284_305,"They are wrong.
"
p284_306,"I can live with it.
"
p284_307,"Work has started.
"
p284_308,"In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
"
p284_309,"The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
"
p284_310,"You should be.
"
p284_311,"The minister is the engineer.
"
p284_312,"The letters are going out today.
"
p284_313,"We want to play at the worlds.
"
p284_314,"The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
"
p284_315,"and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
"
p284_316,"Special measures were needed.
"
p284_317,"The Premier League has been a huge success.
"
p284_318,"The show is at an end.
"
p284_319,"Your father was a good man.
"
p284_320,"Such actions are rarely popular.
"
p284_321,"We have got to get the points from this one.
"
p284_322,"The election is total confusion and chaos.
"
p284_323,"Henman has been warned.
"
p284_324,"I would love it.
"
p284_325,"Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
"
p284_326,"The problems began a long time ago.
"
p284_327,"For the moment, our position remains the same.
"
p284_328,"Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
"
p284_329,"We are in the end game.
"
p284_330,"They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
"
p284_331,"There was no time scale.
"
p284_332,"But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
"
p284_333,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p284_334,"Relief was beyond belief.
"
p284_335,"On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
"
p284_336,"Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
"
p284_337,"Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
"
p284_338,"Finally, he paid for the movie.
"
p284_339,"You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
"
p284_340,"In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
"
p284_341,"He was the architect.
"
p284_342,"Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
"
p284_343,"He has to learn.
"
p284_344,"Two people were interviewed.
"
p284_345,"I've got no secret.
"
p284_346,"This is a big advantage.
"
p284_347,"I'm very lucky.
"
