p238_001,"Please call Stella.
"
p238_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
"
p238_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
"
p238_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
"
p238_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
"
p238_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
"
p238_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
"
p238_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
"
p238_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
"
p238_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it.
"
p238_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
"
p238_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
"
p238_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
"
p238_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
"
p238_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
"
p238_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
"
p238_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
"
p238_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
"
p238_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
"
p238_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
"
p238_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
"
p238_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
"
p238_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
"
p238_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p238_025,"Smoking is also very important.
"
p238_026,"The first appeared to be successful.
"
p238_027,"We must convince the citizens.
"
p238_028,"There was a rush of water.
"
p238_029,"Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
"
p238_030,"Further management changes are planned.
"
p238_031,"Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
"
p238_032,"The staff are very good.
"
p238_033,"Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
"
p238_034,"Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
"
p238_035,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p238_036,"Let there be no doubt about that.
"
p238_037,"The ambition this year is to improve on last.
"
p238_038,"Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
"
p238_039,"And so was a photograph.
"
p238_040,"I remember that day well.
"
p238_041,"She became a heroine of my childhood.
"
p238_042,"We want to get back into the Champions League.
"
p238_043,"The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
"
p238_044,"It is about regular committed giving which is the real attraction.
"
p238_045,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p238_046,"Separate approvals would be needed for these.
"
p238_047,"They have shown a great desire and attitude.
"
p238_048,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p238_049,"It comes from reflection or thinking.
"
p238_050,"The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
"
p238_051,"And they removed a Borderer.
"
p238_052,"He is too weak to move.
"
p238_053,"Does it matter ?
"
p238_054,"How do you take them away ?
"
p238_055,"However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
"
p238_056,"After the match, do you ?
"
p238_057,"Has the conflict started ?
"
p238_058,"Have I really come to this ?
"
p238_059,"They desperately want some stability.
"
p238_060,"Well, he is an artist.
"
p238_061,"We work for the athlete.
"
p238_062,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p238_063,"Everything else is a bonus.
"
p238_064,"He will need that machine.
"
p238_065,"We hadn't really taken that seriously before.
"
p238_066,"It's the performance we want.
"
p238_067,"Then they scored two goals to win.
"
p238_068,"In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
"
p238_069,"The partnership was set up during the summer.
"
p238_070,"The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
"
p238_071,"Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
"
p238_072,"I had relied on him.
"
p238_073,"And then there's the racial hassle.
"
p238_074,"We felt it was sufficient.
"
p238_075,"The wingers must have felt the cold.
"
p238_076,"I am relishing the challenge.
"
p238_077,"I have made that offer.
"
p238_078,"No plans for projects are yet in place.
"
p238_079,"But the organisers refused to worry.
"
p238_080,"We have to keep our clients.
"
p238_081,"We should be able to cope.
"
p238_082,"The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
"
p238_083,"The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
"
p238_084,"He's very young and very keen to do well.
"
p238_085,"It is somewhere to be.
"
p238_086,"We should all be grateful.
"
p238_087,"We will pay their bills.
"
p238_088,"It was exactly four months away.
"
p238_089,"This is equally relevant to the landowner.
"
p238_090,"He thought she was amazing.
"
p238_091,"The result is utterly compelling.
"
p238_092,"Final proposals will be published in February.
"
p238_093,"He seems to have everything.
"
p238_094,"There can be no compromise on welfare.
"
p238_095,"It wasn't possible to relax.
"
p238_096,"He was at home with his pals.
"
p238_097,"I was very pleased with them today, though.
"
p238_098,"Maybe this battle has been.
"
p238_099,"Then followed a bout of flu.
"
p238_100,"Both sides have been hit by injury.
"
p238_101,"It will take a few years before we see the full benefit.
"
p238_102,"It's very dangerous for markets.
"
p238_103,"The fans would love it.
"
p238_104,"That would be the case with Dundee.
"
p238_105,"Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.
"
p238_106,"Talk of a crisis is absurd.

"
p238_111,"After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
"
p238_112,"Harrowing is easy, after all.
"
p238_113,"Those people must be accountable.
"
p238_114,"If they liked it then I'll be happy.
"
p238_115,"It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
"
p238_116,"Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
"
p238_117,"Many others are subjected to violence by men.
"
p238_118,"It's going to be epic.
"
p238_119,"What form did that take ?
"
p238_120,"Are they free ?
"
p238_121,"What are they for ?
"
p238_122,"Is there a waiting list ?
"
p238_123,"Do they think anyone else wants them ?
"
p238_124,"So what happens next ?
"
p238_125,"Had this been common practice ?
"
p238_126,"What do they want us to do ?
"
p238_127,"Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
"
p238_128,"He put some colour into Scottish history.
"
p238_129,"They lived for their children.
"
p238_130,"Potions said he would drive.
"
p238_131,"This is a sizeable part of our business.

p238_134,"The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
"
p238_135,"No one person or small group could be singled out.
"
p238_136,"Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
"
p238_137,"I won't make an official complaint.
"
p238_138,"Monty is great in his own backyard.
"
p238_139,"Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
"
p238_140,"This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
"
p238_141,"Even the winning club was within seconds of disaster.
"
p238_142,"The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
"
p238_143,"But it looks good for next year.
"
p238_144,"All the employees are redundant.
"
p238_145,"His claims were criticised by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith.
"
p238_146,"Four meetings have previously been arranged.
"
p238_147,"Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
"
p238_148,"The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
"
p238_149,"And they all have a vote.
"
p238_150,"It is a vicious circle.
"
p238_151,"Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
"
p238_152,"Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
"
p238_154,"They make a selective perception process.
"
p238_155,"That's what happened against Ayr.
"
p238_156,"Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
"
p238_157,"The following are the principal provisions.
"
p238_158,"But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
"
p238_159,"Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
"
p238_160,"His job was not advertised.
"
p238_161,"He was just like a godfather to it.
"
p238_162,"The milk industry is in turmoil.
"
p238_163,"He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
"
p238_164,"Yet the survey has been cautious.
"
p238_165,"The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
"
p238_166,"YOU cannot blame the turnout.
"
p238_167,"We can't get over it.
"
p238_168,"They almost achieved a draw.
"
p238_169,"I can see it now.
"
p238_170,"This is a step backwards.
"
p238_171,"I've no idea how it works.
"
p238_172,"We continue to hold the shares.
"
p238_173,"The festivals will be about having fun.

p238_182,"The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
"
p238_183,"Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
"
p238_184,"They keep the atmosphere in mind.
"
p238_185,"But we could only help a handful of people.
"
p238_186,"Scottish football is finally on its way back.
"
p238_187,"This is a frightening development.
"
p238_188,"He is survived by his wife and two sons.
"
p238_189,"This should begin in October.
"
p238_190,"You just have to accept.
"
p238_191,"There is no evidence that these people are helpful.
"
p238_192,"The Yugoslav army will still be there.
"
p238_193,"The squad is too small.
"
p238_194,"He has had success at every level.
"
p238_195,"This Patton will also return.
"
p238_196,"Tiger is not the norm.
"
p238_197,"His words were not audible.
"
p238_198,"You are a gambling man.
"
p238_199,"Did he trip ?
"
p238_200,"Does that put pressure on us ?
"
p238_201,"Did it work ?
"
p238_202,"Do you think we are a top nation ?
"
p238_203,"Is our children learning ?
"
p238_204,"How independent is that ?
"
p238_206,"Truth is the child of time.
"
p238_207,"There was a fine line to tread.
"
p238_208,"The refund is fully justified.
"
p238_209,"Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
"
p238_211,"But experts have disputed that statistic.
"
p238_212,"It is time for confession.
"
p238_213,"He has many offers from the English Premiership.
"
p238_214,"Hospital staff described his condition as serious but stable.
"
p238_215,"In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
"
p238_216,"It was started almost by accident.
"
p238_217,"I will not take part in Edmonton.
"
p238_218,"We will try to find someone.
"
p238_219,"Bottling is now the core business.
"
p238_220,"Frankly, it was worth the booking.
"
p238_221,"The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
"
p238_222,"People have been wonderful beyond belief.
"
p238_223,"We were right to be afraid.
"
p238_224,"The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
"
p238_225,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p238_226,"I am considered a teenager.
"
p238_227,"Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
"
p238_228,"Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
"
p238_229,"That view has not altered.
"
p238_230,"Its's all change at Kilmarnock.
"
p238_231,"So I got a blood test.
"
p238_232,"No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
"
p238_233,"Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
"
p238_234,"There's always the next century.
"
p238_235,"For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
"
p238_236,"That proved enough to settle the home side down.
"
p238_237,"Here was an anti supporting the Bill.
"
p238_238,"Five years later, the deception continued.
"
p238_239,"Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
"
p238_240,"There's only one team in Ayrshire.
"
p238_241,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p238_242,"It is not normal practice.
"
p238_243,"It is crucial for both teams.
"
p238_244,"Mr Blair had done well.
"
p238_245,"I was a lucky man tonight.
"
p238_246,"Then we will face the Danish champions.
"
p238_247,"But it couldn't happen overnight.
"
p238_248,"It would seem a natural progression.
"
p238_249,"Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
"
p238_250,"My Dad is a hero.
"
p238_251,"And they were being paid ?
"
p238_252,"was everything done to save people ?
"
p238_253,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p238_254,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p238_255,"Is it in the right place ?
"
p238_256,"This wasn't just a big crowd.
"
p238_257,"It was a terrible combination of factors.
"
p238_258,"This is absolutely not true.
"
p238_259,"Arsenal refused to be evicted.
"
p238_260,"It's about time something was done about equipment.
"
p238_261,"They should stop the bombing.
"
p238_262,"Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
"
p238_263,"Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
"
p238_264,"It is a terrible tragedy.
"
p238_265,"The agreement remains the only show in town.
"
p238_266,"The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
"
p238_267,"The strong performance is expected to continue.
"
p238_268,"The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
"
p238_269,"It was a bit of a tightrope.
"
p238_270,"It's never great to finish second.
"
p238_271,"I'm delighted that Celtic have done so well this season.
"
p238_272,"Her political persuasion is no secret.
"
p238_273,"Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
"
p238_274,"He is a right bastard.
"
p238_275,"Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
"
p238_276,"They could not match it.
"
p238_277,"He is not a pathetic figure.
"
p238_278,"The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
"
p238_279,"I came up through the ranks.
"
p238_280,"You've got to be vigilant.
"
p238_281,"First, the programme was unbalanced.
"
p238_282,"The happiness was slightly misplaced.
"
p238_283,"Phase one was a shambles.
"
p238_284,"This championship is different from the other majors.
"
p238_285,"But I was glad to see these interviews.
"
p238_286,"Each case is treated on merit.
"
p238_287,"They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
"
p238_288,"Says the Duke of York.
"
p238_289,"He is a serial Conservative assassin.
"
p238_290,"We've just had it confirmed.
"
p238_291,"Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
"
p238_292,"Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
"
p238_293,"She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
"
p238_294,"We've had great things in the past.
"
p238_295,"It has been recorded twice.
"
p238_296,"But there's an upturn in the sector.
"
p238_297,"I'm interested in interesting work.
"
p238_298,"They will probably come back.
"
p238_299,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p238_300,"Does the name matter ?
"
p238_301,"how do you get it back ?
"
p238_302,"What are you not good at ?
"
p238_303,"I think, therefore I am ?
"
p238_304,"Who was she ?
"
p238_305,"Motorists will buy passes in advance.
"
p238_306,"No-one is predicting a sudden rebound.
"
p238_307,"Friday night was a pretty good night.
"
p238_308,"This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
"
p238_309,"You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
"
p238_310,"We are trying to clarify the issues.
"
p238_311,"I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
"
p238_312,"Pulled a huge number of viewers.
"

"
p238_314,"Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
"
p238_315,"Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
"
p238_316,"That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
"
p238_317,"Here the picture is broadly stable.
"
p238_318,"Sadly, it does not end there.
"
p238_319,"Jim has not been a problem for me at all.
"
p238_320,"Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
"
p238_321,"We believe a third party was involved.
"
p238_322,"And we have the experience.
"
p238_323,"The early physical reports were clear.
"
p238_324,"Celtic were the losers then.
"
p238_325,"Their conclusions were never published.
"
p238_326,"Confidence among the allies began to slip.
"
p238_327,"Little is known about them.
"
p238_328,"Margins are also in retreat.
"
p238_329,"Golf is not like that.
"
p238_330,"It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
"
p238_331,"The move follows a review of the Singapore
"
p238_332,"Which isn't a bad idea.
"
p238_333,"Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
"
p238_334,"They will always be in our hearts and in our minds.
"
p238_335,"He was admitted to hospital.
"
p238_336,"Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
"
p238_337,"Abbey National is an option.
"
p238_338,"We've had him with us for the past six weeks.
"
p238_339,"Harry Potter has lost his magic.
"
p238_340,"Today we must not repeat that mistake.

p238_341,"Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
"
p238_342,"He is the son of former chairman, Lord Wolfson.
"
p238_343,"Scottish consumer protection groups were generally receptive to the proposals.
"
p238_344,"This is a sensible and common sense approach.
"
p238_345,"My daughter is an adult.
"
p238_346,"His third goal was superb.
"
p238_347,"I'm very relieved that I have finally won.
"
p238_349,"My father died in childbirth.
"
p238_350,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p238_351,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p238_352,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p238_353,"This measure is not adjusted for seasonal factors.
"
p238_354,"They're going to open in early summer.
"
p238_355,"Anyway, the job will be part-time.
"
p238_356,"I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
"
p238_357,"And the World Cup has not even begun.
"
p238_358,"He remains a main board director of Royal.
"
p238_359,"People should make their own decisions.
"
p238_360,"I saw them last week.
"
