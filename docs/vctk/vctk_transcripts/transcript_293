p293_001,Please call Stella.
p293_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p293_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p293_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p293_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p293_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p293_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p293_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p293_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p293_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p293_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p293_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p293_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p293_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p293_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p293_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p293_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p293_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p293_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p293_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p293_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p293_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p293_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p293_025,"It's not, of course, a concert hall."
p293_026,Theatre is not a museum.
p293_027,"It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player."
p293_028,All my training is for Athens.
p293_029,"Subs not used, McCulloch."
p293_030,I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p293_032,We are satisfied with this outcome.
p293_033,Several others were absent.
p293_034,"I asked for a picture and she said, No problem."
p293_035,There is a lot of heroin about.
p293_036,There is a growing anger among the group.
p293_037,I have got to adopt the same approach.
p293_038,Seven people were later detained by police.
p293_039,It's a sensible management decision.
p293_040,Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p293_041,I would just like someone to confess.
p293_042,"Sub Not Used, McCormick."
p293_043,We can be proud of our achievements.
p293_044,Clark is back on top form.
p293_045,He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p293_046,Lothian and Borders Police are also involved.
p293_047,"That was the theory, anyway."
p293_048,Ferguson must take the blame.
p293_049,This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p293_050,"In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win."
p293_051,Stealing from the benefits system is no different.
p293_052,It is a large number.
p293_053,"We felt at the moment, it was not possible."
p293_054,"General, You didn't get a modified."
p293_055,It does not even have a staff shortage.
p293_056,That is our unfinished business.
p293_057,This is far too high.
p293_058,The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p293_059,"In fact, he was talking about the survival business."
p293_060,But the foundations have been laid.
p293_061,This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p293_062,So they will settle again.
p293_063,He had other things on his mind.
p293_064,Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p293_065,Let us hope so.
p293_066,"It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone."
p293_067,"A lot of people had to wait, and people still do."
p293_068,It felt like my support system was leaving.
p293_069,A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p293_070,I was shaking on the blocks.
p293_071,So the challenge is against ourselves.
p293_072,"You see, my back has gone."
p293_073,It has been a lovely family occasion.
p293_074,We've had our problems at the club.
p293_075,His behaviour today has been disgusting.

p293_079,All the people thought that we would die.
p293_080,Sometimes they come off.
p293_081,"A teacher is, really, about unity."
p293_082,Our nation has been changed by this event.
p293_083,"However, my position remains the same."
p293_084,"However, it's good to turn the page."
p293_085,There are plenty examples.
p293_086,Self control is just one instalment.
p293_087,It's an hour of the same response.
p293_088,I could not believe what they were saying.
p293_089,"A hard act to follow, but it is being followed."
p293_090,Will he be given time?
p293_091,Beyond that would have been outrageous.
p293_092,I seem to keep this for the majors.
p293_093,The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
p293_094,We've been overwhelmed by the response.
p293_095,Her presence was almost everywhere.
p293_096,But the cost to his health was enormous.
p293_097,It has been hijacked.
p293_098,"And he's the first to see that, and say that."
p293_099,They must put them back.
p293_100,You do have a way out.
p293_101,Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p293_102,This is not a European Army.
p293_103,These guys are looking for business.
p293_104,"And, also, when he does not have the ball."
p293_105,I have also been delighted with Stevie.
p293_106,It was different in the endurance events.
p293_107,They will now have to justify their position.
p293_108,"It didn't help him, as far as we had seen."
p293_109,The objective was achieved.
p293_110,"So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy."
p293_111,Look at his last couple of records.
p293_112,There is no musical background in his family.
p293_113,The cost of war is more than that.

p293_120,"He also wants to play in this game, and that's important."
p293_121,This is excellent news for Glasgow.
p293_122,"If that is the perception, that has to be addressed."
p293_123,Eriksson would have approved.
p293_124,You ask the question.
p293_125,"Next league matches, Motherwell Dunfermline."
p293_126,"Eriksson, though, was having none of it."
p293_127,The Taliban response was swift.
p293_128,Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p293_129,"In fact, they should have scored three times."

p293_132,The firm was down and almost out.
p293_133,Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p293_134,"Fifteen minutes later, they were found."
p293_135,"It was very, very difficult for me to look at this."
p293_136,That is why we are here.
p293_137,"Hopefully, he will get a lucky break."
p293_138,Somehow they got out.

p293_140,I've been very nervous.
p293_141,Ireland is also prepared to take in refugees.
p293_142,"However, the second goal was about to be delivered."
p293_143,The proposals were never taken seriously.
p293_144,The Treasury denied the claims.
p293_145,The same goes for McKenna.
p293_146,Perhaps it should stay there.
p293_147,You can be sure we will have problems.
p293_148,"Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't."
p293_149,We had to take action to protect them.
p293_150,We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p293_151,Our policy is clear.
p293_152,I think we have a very strong case.
p293_153,"Who would be out there, singing?"
p293_154,"It is very simple, no-one is forced to compete."
p293_155,"However, his remarks were heavily qualified."
p293_156,It's something he has worked very hard on.
p293_157,Horses have some sense.
p293_158,"Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging."

p293_160,The only answer is a public inquiry.

p293_162,"However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter."

p293_166,It is physical but it is also good.
p293_167,It's unfair on her.
p293_168,"So, easy does it."
p293_169,I just want to enjoy myself.
p293_170,We are concerned that things should be safe.
p293_171,At this point we can only speculate.
p293_172,Family members are at her bedside.
p293_173,I am very shocked.
p293_174,The people here are quite reserved.
p293_175,When will this change?
p293_176,It has made me feel good.
p293_177,It's been such a long haul.
p293_178,This gives us a lot of practice.

p293_236,"Life, as many people know it, in other words."
p293_237,That was my own personal decision.

p293_239,She returned home a few days later.
p293_240,I have been here for only three months.
p293_241,So what's wrong with Scotland?
p293_242,She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
p293_243,How can they engage with the work?
p293_244,It gave me something to focus on.
p293_245,We live by the rule of law.
p293_246,"He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth."
p293_247,She is fulfilled by it.
p293_248,But one shouldn't go by that.
p293_249,Nobody has been put on trial.
p293_250,Advice and counselling will be offered.
p293_251,"Also, he was flawed."

p293_335,They had asked not to be named.
p293_336,"Well, until recently he didn't think so."
p293_337,A whole range of factors are involved.
p293_338,"There may be some work in construction, but not enough."
