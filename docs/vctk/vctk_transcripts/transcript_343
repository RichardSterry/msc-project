p343_001,Please call Stella.
p343_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p343_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p343_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p343_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p343_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p343_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p343_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p343_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p343_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p343_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p343_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p343_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p343_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p343_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p343_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p343_019,"Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p343_020,Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p343_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p343_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p343_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p343_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p343_025,I've got a long way to go.
p343_026,I'll go to the races.
p343_027,We will be back next year.
p343_028,"I was very, very pleased with our display."
p343_029,It is a crucial award.
p343_030,"People don't feel safe, including me."
p343_031,Survival is our aim.
p343_032,But it might have done.
p343_033,Nor is it likely to do so.
p343_034,What can you do?
p343_035,I read it every year.
p343_036,I go in for the parts.
p343_037,It should be the reverse.
p343_038,We are a team of hard workers.
p343_039,It is up to Ann.
p343_040,And you know something?
p343_041,We were with him the whole time.
p343_042,"That was the theory, anyway."
p343_043,We've all been here before.
p343_044,I had troubles with the producers.
p343_045,"So, it took me back to boarding school."
p343_046,He died the following year.
p343_047,That's what we're trying to achieve.
p343_048,He is trying really hard.
p343_049,I have no doubt about that.
p343_050,It is a beautiful country.
p343_051,I expect a rapid response.
p343_052,There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p343_053,This was never a support group.
p343_054,I must take a seat.
p343_055,My mother is a widow.
p343_056,Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p343_057,"Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious."
p343_058,The matter will come up again.
p343_059,I don't believe in gesture politics.
p343_060,The decision is purely down to the clinic.
p343_061,He should be a great asset.
p343_062,But that's another story for another day.
p343_063,One thing is sure.
p343_064,He has really done well.
p343_065,I'm just delighted to take it.
p343_066,This happened on three days inside a week.
p343_067,Funding needs to be long term.
p343_068,It's funny how it comes and goes.
p343_069,It was just awful.
p343_070,That is really all.
p343_071,We played too deeply.
p343_072,We could have got three medals.
p343_073,I am ready to go.
p343_074,We are still suffering from that.
p343_075,The script was funny.
p343_076,We are at the crossroads.
p343_077,I am about protecting the state pension.
p343_078,They were at school together.
p343_079,I am looking forward to getting home.
p343_080,"Painful, but only because it's true."
p343_081,Once they go away they won't come back.
p343_082,"Colonel, About this committee that is coming."
p343_083,That was the easy election.
p343_084,I didn't understand it.
p343_085,We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p343_086,Both sides have been hit by injury.
p343_087,No one was listening.
p343_088,I will report in the spring.
p343_089,We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p343_090,"I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier."
p343_091,It's terrible that this is happening.
p343_092,He's got the same story.
p343_093,"They were going through the motions, but that's about all."
p343_094,"It is par for the course, of course."
p343_095,And so it goes on.
p343_096,The winner will be announced next month.
p343_097,What was this?
p343_098,I am not a fan of books.
p343_099,It may well have been.
p343_100,"Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself."
p343_101,We can only go up.
p343_102,I am not a doctor.
p343_103,It is all in the mind.
p343_104,And we have beaten them before.
p343_105,Many others are subjected to violence by men.
p343_106,"Actually, it turned out to be the concerto."
p343_107,I am not a paedophile.
p343_108,I've got to get noticed!
p343_109,Not that it was needed.
p343_110,It's up to them to decide.
p343_111,But we can't have a casino.
p343_112,I would love to play in Europe again.
p343_113,The odds are that it will.
p343_114,"After this, they were always in the driving seat."
p343_115,I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p343_116,But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
p343_117,He also has property interests in the country.
p343_118,That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p343_119,The hearing was expected to last six weeks.
p343_120,I cannot believe this decision.
p343_121,This decision is destroying my family.
p343_122,Why is that?
p343_123,"Well, the big day has arrived."
p343_124,We reckon we can do very well.
p343_125,But it's been kept to a minimum.
p343_126,It has been a great day.
p343_127,We are not with you.
p343_128,Then came the crunch.
p343_129,"If so, they were wrong."
p343_130,It is open season on the Old Firm.
p343_131,The answer is maybe.
p343_132,The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p343_133,The referee had a shocking game.
p343_134,I haven't been able to do it since.
p343_135,It's about doing things.
p343_136,For a few years we had good fun.
p343_137,All the pressure will be on him.
p343_139,This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p343_140,That was a good effort.
p343_141,We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
p343_142,He must not be removed from office.
p343_143,He had finally had enough.
p343_144,But not all were so defiant.
p343_145,We are not going to get carried away.
p343_146,I told that to the police.
p343_147,"On the other hand, the poster did not help."
p343_148,"In the end, we did not spend a penny on him."
p343_149,But when we do it it is great.
p343_150,I'm going to win the gold.
p343_151,He pleaded for caution.
p343_152,It always had to be about the gym.
p343_153,Only one got through.
p343_154,It's like a garage.
p343_155,They've been wonderful to me.
p343_157,I can't believe the buzz.
p343_158,It is a traffic warden.
p343_159,"When it comes down to it, this is a job."
p343_160,It had been played at festivals.
p343_161,That never came to court as a charge.
p343_162,Dancing was her life.
p343_163,The latter way is my way.
p343_164,Staff have been informed.
p343_165,It is one of those things.
p343_166,His is a success story by any standard.
p343_167,Are his works inside out?
p343_168,He can do no wrong.
p343_169,"On reflection, it was really quite exciting."
p343_170,Do they have to create seven majors?
p343_171,It has been handled entirely properly.
p343_172,I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p343_173,Is something which we just don't do.
p343_174,That began as an accident.
p343_175,"It is, though the law is not clear cut."
p343_176,He will want to utilise the midfield.
p343_177,Two others were also seriously injured.
p343_178,I am looking forward to this film.
p343_179,This has been very frustrating for him.
p343_180,The talking cannot go on too long.
p343_181,I've got a young family.
p343_182,I hope that that will be forthcoming.
p343_183,But experience is a wonderful thing.
p343_184,Footage has been passed on to the police.
p343_185,"Of course, there was still much to be done."
p343_186,"If he does, he has a real chance of gold."
p343_187,"Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United."
p343_188,It was good today.
p343_189,She really suffered for her art.
p343_190,I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p343_191,That tells you something.
p343_192,It has been a magical moment.
p343_193,Is that not uncanny?
p343_194,Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p343_195,The hotel was huge.
p343_196,These days are over.
p343_197,A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p343_198,"Well, you can have a tree."
p343_199,Or so it is hoped.
p343_201,He said to give a local injection.
p343_202,This is an internal matter.
p343_203,Entries from the event are still being accepted.
p343_204,They made such decisions in London.
p343_205,That has proved to be a lasting lesson.
p343_206,I was influenced by all of these things.
p343_207,He is helping police with their inquiries.
p343_208,The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p343_209,Children also died in Britain.
p343_210,I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
p343_211,We want to get there.
p343_213,His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p343_214,He said he would appeal the sentences.
p343_215,The hearing was fair.
p343_216,He has the edge.
p343_217,This was not a summit about the euro.
p343_218,"If he leaves, the band is finished."
p343_219,He saw it all as a big game.
p343_220,I didn't actually work up a speech.
p343_221,Here we have not had one hour.
p343_222,That was never their agenda.
p343_223,But he kept on repeating it.
p343_224,She is currently in foster care.
p343_225,That's the only thing that matters.
p343_226,They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p343_227,The service will only survive with change.
p343_228,"It is, however, an unlikely outcome."
p343_229,"As it was a double, it was pretty expensive."
p343_230,You have a very persuasive president.
p343_231,"It's always the same, isn't it?"
p343_232,She has not returned to work.
p343_233,We could learn a lot from them.
p343_234,He is the saviour of South Africa.
p343_235,The players are obviously keen to do well.
p343_236,Men should avoid it like the plague.
p343_237,It's really good fun.
p343_238,Our positions remains unchanged.
p343_239,We are expecting a big crowd.
p343_240,Is a drug dealer?
p343_241,We did not complete the process.
p343_242,"Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands."
p343_243,Where are you taking her?
p343_244,The weather forecast isn't good.
p343_245,They have not been named.
p343_246,He died later in hospital.
p343_247,"It is ambitious, but it can be achieved."
p343_248,He had a great game.
p343_249,It's still got that at its heart.
p343_250,"Actually, nothing much will change."
p343_251,We will turn the corner.
p343_252,"Of course, it is a tough assignment."
p343_253,There were too many mistakes.
p343_254,He says it often enough.
p343_255,"However, my position remains the same."
p343_256,It was totally out of the blue.
p343_257,Horses are not affected.
p343_258,It went on forever.
p343_259,I'm not going to change from it.
p343_260,And they are different.
p343_261,It would have been very easily done.
p343_262,He knows the course.
p343_263,That idea is rubbish.
p343_264,There is no room for error.
p343_265,Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p343_266,"As, indeed, they would be."
p343_267,"If he could have prevented it happening, he would have."
p343_268,We are all suffering.
p343_269,People should make their own decisions.
p343_270,That is a question for the next manager.
p343_271,I knew people on that committee.
p343_273,"Again, we were lucky."
p343_274,There was no argument.
p343_275,He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
p343_276,She is a valuable member of Government.
p343_277,I just need a bit of luck.
p343_278,But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p343_279,We are talking about one family.
p343_280,He is not a pathetic figure.
p343_281,The error appeared in a warrant.
p343_282,Everything is so new.
p343_283,It may take time to get it back.
p343_284,Would they work together again?
p343_285,I can feel the sound inside.
p343_286,The answer is yes.
p343_287,I believe in debate and dialogue.
p343_288,The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p343_289,That is a personal matter.
p343_290,The princess has had other health problems.
p343_291,I would rather say nothing at the moment.
p343_292,The clarity is vital.
p343_293,I could not sit in the stands.
p343_294,He had a decision to make.
p343_295,Strikers like to go to the ground.
p343_296,It makes no influence on the public.
p343_297,It's ahead of Labour.
p343_298,It's the whole package.
p343_299,I was totally wrong.
p343_300,This has got to stop.
p343_301,It was a matter of chance.
p343_302,There is no point of looking any further.
p343_303,It is a real concern.
p343_304,Is it the flight?
p343_306,"Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this."
p343_307,Scotland doesn't even have a target.
p343_308,They really shouldn't have put it out.
p343_309,A compromise is essential.
p343_310,"Last night, the company could not be contacted."
p343_311,They need to be involved.
p343_312,It was not a cover-up.
p343_313,The children continue to talk to us.
p343_314,You know the sort of thing.
p343_315,I cannot say too much about them.
p343_316,She went home from school and never returned.
p343_317,I will work on her.
p343_318,We told them in August.
p343_319,It is not easy to live in Russia.
p343_320,Green is desperate to play on The Open.
p343_321,What on earth is happening to rugby?
p343_322,It is now being examined.
p343_323,It is so out of character.
p343_324,Otherwise we would all pay the price.
p343_325,Our thoughts are with her.
p343_326,"It is time, he said."
p343_327,Everyone believes in it.
p343_328,We must learn to finish.
p343_331,He was a one off.
p343_332,That should give me a chance.
p343_333,Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p343_334,It is my last chance.
p343_335,We played them off the pitch.
p343_336,The service from the other players was super.
p343_337,That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.
p343_338,He didn't let me down.
p343_339,You have been warned.
p343_340,We're not comparing like with like.
p343_341,I started on fire a couple of times.
p343_342,The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.
p343_343,"It wasn't good, but we'll get better."
p343_344,They will be up for it for sure.
p343_345,So you let me know.
p343_346,"He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal."
p343_347,That will just be the beginning.
p343_348,No one can say that about me.
p343_349,That had not happened on this occasion.
p343_350,"After that time, the market itself will set the prices."
p343_351,"As a nation, we must become more active."
p343_352,"At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own."
p343_353,It is safe in our hands.
p343_354,HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p343_355,We will need to look at that.
p343_356,It comes down to the police in England.
p343_357,Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p343_358,It is a gamble.
p343_359,"I expected a victory, the pain is enormous."
p343_360,The tribunal continues today.
p343_361,These things have not happened by accident.
p343_362,"So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland."
p343_363,"Sure, that already happens in New Zealand."
p343_364,There's a hint of classical.
p343_365,We had to take action to protect them.
p343_366,Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.
p343_367,"In the end, however, it all came together."
p343_368,He is a visionary.
p343_369,The warning was lifted late last night.
p343_370,There is always the smell.
p343_371,I have to take some of the blame.
p343_372,And if he hasn't become a musician?
p343_374,He is lying to save his skin.
p343_375,You have to do your research.
p343_376,"He really has everything, including a beautiful swing."
p343_377,He took away my childhood.
p343_378,I have spoken to the skipper.
p343_379,The call was ignored.
p343_381,"It has happened, and that is the end of the story."
p343_382,"We don't do this for everyone, of course."
p343_383,And there is another problem.
p343_384,That is the theory.
p343_385,It almost certainly is.
p343_386,They will have five minutes to decide.
p343_387,Because it's a secret.
p343_388,My wife and family are the support system.
p343_389,The body follows the mind.
p343_390,"I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth."
p343_391,They are there to help us.
p343_392,It just isn't a defining issue for them.
p343_393,You take a risk.
p343_394,"Which he is, too."
p343_395,Each one is as good as the other.
p343_396,"Sub Not Used, McArthur."
p343_397,I have hardly any commitments.
p343_398,There is no formula.
p343_399,"The role was a knockout, but really difficult."
p343_400,I love the feel of the place.
