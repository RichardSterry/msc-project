p240_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p240_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p240_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p240_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p240_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p240_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p240_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p240_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p240_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p240_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p240_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p240_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p240_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p240_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p240_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p240_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p240_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p240_018,"Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p240_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p240_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p240_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p240_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p240_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p240_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p240_025,"Johnson was pretty low.
"
p240_026,"But it failed.
"
p240_027,"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
"
p240_028,"Is this accurate?
"
p240_029,"I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
"
p240_030,"They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
"
p240_031,"We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
"
p240_032,"They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
"
p240_033,"This is the window.
"
p240_034,"People love to see this stuff.
"
p240_035,"He took me on a tour of the wards.
"
p240_036,"It is marvellous.
"
p240_037,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p240_038,"It has failed.
"
p240_039,"They're just different.
"
p240_040,"It's a real threat.
"
p240_041,"It was the eighties.
"
p240_042,"Indeed, he does.
"
p240_043,"President Bush is at war.
"
p240_044,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p240_045,"On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
"
p240_046,"You must always attempt to raise the bar.
"
p240_047,"It is so sad.
"
p240_048,"That period was a struggle.
"
p240_049,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p240_050,"Who can say?
"
p240_051,"It's a blessing.
"
p240_052,"The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
"
p240_053,"Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
"
p240_054,"He is too weak to move.
"
p240_055,"Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
"
p240_056,"He had no enemies.
"
p240_057,"I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
"
p240_058,"However the drama was still not at an end.
"
p240_059,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p240_060,"That's the truth.
"
p240_061,"The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
"
p240_062,"I've had six days of rehearsal.
"
p240_063,"He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
"
p240_064,"Art is extra.
"
p240_065,"Scotland had great assets.
"
p240_066,"They are real.
"
p240_067,"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
"
p240_068,"I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
"
p240_069,"It should be devolved.
"
p240_070,"We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
"
p240_071,"It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
"
p240_072,"I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
"
p240_073,"I was as strong as a horse.
"
p240_074,"They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
"
p240_075,"The girls are so lucky to be alive.
"
p240_076,"She died in hospital two hours later.
"
p240_077,"Is there a new way forward?
"
p240_078,"I've got the shirt.
"
p240_079,"Today she has been released.
"
p240_080,"The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
"
p240_081,"Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
"
p240_082,"What has changed?
"
p240_083,"He is in the queue.
"
p240_084,"He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
"
p240_085,"Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
"
p240_086,"Someone who cares
"
p240_087,"Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
"
p240_088,"Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
"
p240_089,"They lived for their children.
"
p240_090,"That will come after the game on Saturday.
"
p240_091,"Today I couldn't run on it.
"
p240_092,"She told The Herald.
"
p240_093,"We could not get any possession.
"
p240_094,"He is hungry for success and I am the same.
"
p240_095,"It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
"
p240_096,"They were outside the circle.
"
p240_097,"He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days.
"
p240_098,"It was a good performance.
"
p240_099,"I see no need for change.
"
p240_100,"We have every respect for Michelle.
"
p240_101,"But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
"
p240_102,"He takes the job.
"
p240_103,"They will want to perform well.
"
p240_104,"That all hope is never lost.
"
p240_105,"It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
"
p240_106,"Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward.
"
p240_107,"It's in his blood.
"
p240_108,"It's a shame.
"
p240_109,"It had been played at festivals.
"
p240_110,"I came to complete.
"
p240_111,"It's a question of perception.
"
p240_112,"In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
"
p240_113,"This film will be totally awesome.
"
p240_114,"Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
"
p240_115,"I'm delighted about that.
"
p240_116,"Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
"
p240_117,"I joined a group.
"
p240_118,"This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
"
p240_119,"She really suffered for her art.
"
p240_120,"It is a delight on every level.
"
p240_121,"You can spend money on housing.
"
p240_122,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p240_123,"It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
"
p240_124,"Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
"
p240_125,"I was furious.
"
p240_126,"His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
"
p240_127,"It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
"
p240_128,"Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
"
p240_129,"I do not think this family will ever get over this.
"
p240_130,"Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
"
p240_131,"Offered the gold medal, he declined.
"
p240_132,"It was the same at Twickenham.
"
p240_133,"The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
"
p240_134,"It is also well received.
"
p240_135,"Government will intervene.
"
p240_136,"Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
"
p240_137,"He was in a great deal of pain.
"
p240_138,"We want to keep the pound.
"
p240_139,"It seems so long since I did the exams.
"
p240_140,"And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
"
p240_141,"Wallace was a prisoner of war.
"
p240_142,"Who would be right?
"
p240_143,"She died at her home.
"
p240_144,"I am just trying to do my job.
"
p240_145,"It opens the door to the Champions League.
"
p240_146,"It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
"
p240_147,"They did very well.
"
p240_148,"Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
"
p240_149,"It was deployed in the Gulf War.
"
p240_150,"It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
"
p240_151,"Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
"
p240_152,"Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
"
p240_153,"Mr Blair had done well.
"
p240_154,"I was in daily contact.
"
p240_155,"My Dad is a hero.
"
p240_156,"The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
"
p240_157,"Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
"
p240_158,"Was this element always there?
"
p240_159,"These days are long gone.
"
p240_160,"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
"
p240_161,"It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
"
p240_162,"I was in the train station overnight.
"
p240_163,"We knew we had the goal we wanted.
"
p240_164,"However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
"
p240_165,"Tell it like it was?
"
p240_166,"We have a budget in March.
"
p240_167,"That must be left to the Parole Board.
"
p240_168,"By then, however, both men were already in the US.
"
p240_169,"They will do their own thing.
"
p240_170,"And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
"
p240_171,"It's quite a routine.
"
p240_172,"The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
"
p240_173,"The hotel was now for sale.
"
p240_174,"I drove the ball well.
"
p240_175,"Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
"
p240_176,"They know no other way.
"
p240_177,"There is no point in looking any further.
"
p240_178,"And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
"
p240_179,"Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
"
p240_180,"They will run a mile.
"
p240_181,"Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
"
p240_182,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p240_183,"Miller was every bit as happy.
"
p240_184,"What has caused the demise of singing?
"
p240_185,"We want to help them through it.
"
p240_186,"They really did a great job.
"
p240_187,"It was an odd affair, in many respects.
"
p240_188,"It is tough, but possible.
"
p240_189,"It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
"
p240_190,"Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
"
p240_191,"The procedure is the same in all cases.
"
p240_192,"People will ask about us.
"
p240_193,"But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
"
p240_194,"It is a farce.
"
p240_195,"I am totally surprised.
"
p240_196,"The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
"
p240_197,"It wasn't to be.
"
p240_198,"There was no option.
"
p240_199,"There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
"
p240_200,"But we are not immune to the problem.
"
p240_201,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p240_202,"Who will pay for this?
"
p240_203,"They've got three-quarters of the way.
"
p240_204,"The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
"
p240_205,"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
"
p240_206,"It's all about money, money, money.
"
p240_207,"We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
"
p240_208,"It's a mixture of everything.
"
p240_209,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p240_210,"The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
"
p240_211,"We'll have to work hard today.
"
p240_212,"She should not be blamed.
"
p240_213,"We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
"
p240_214,"It had all been arranged.
"
p240_215,"A Grampian Police spokesman said.
"
p240_216,"His third goal was superb.
"
p240_217,"I was so nervous.
"
p240_218,"Work has started.
"
p240_219,"For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
"
p240_220,"He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
"
p240_221,"The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
"
p240_222,"It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
"
p240_223,"That has been the easy part.
"
p240_224,"Women were mostly notable by their absence.
"
p240_225,"But it will be sorted out this week.
"
p240_226,"What was the main difference?
"
p240_227,"I am immensely sad.
"
p240_228,"It is a gamble.
"
p240_229,"At the time, he was a living legend.
"
p240_230,"It's so special.
"
p240_231,"They are the innocent victims.
"
p240_232,"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
"
p240_233,"The body follows the mind.
"
p240_234,"However, no further action was taken by police.
"
p240_235,"And thought we would get away with it.
"
p240_236,"Jobs could go.
"
p240_237,"It is not the message alone.
"
p240_238,"It's quite a line-up!
"
p240_239,"It's very safe.
"
p240_240,"But it's a subtle process.
"
p240_241,"Of further privacy, he had no need.
"
p240_242,"He was good, but not that good.
"
p240_243,"We were extremely poor.
"
p240_244,"Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
"
p240_245,"In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
"
p240_246,"It is hard won.
"
p240_247,"A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
"
p240_248,"Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
"
p240_249,"I am the opposite because I haven't played very much.
"
p240_250,"I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
"
p240_251,"In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
"
p240_252,"He got the same story.
"
p240_253,"It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
"
p240_254,"I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
"
p240_255,"A friendship that will endure.
"
p240_256,"He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
"
p240_257,"Her presence was almost everywhere.
"
p240_258,"For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
"
p240_259,"That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
"
p240_260,"Blair is very positive at European Councils.
"
p240_261,"One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
"
p240_262,"So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
"
p240_263,"I was happily surprised.
"
p240_264,"They must play for each other.
"
p240_265,"It is also very valuable.
"
p240_266,"George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
"
p240_267,"Blood samples were taken.
"
p240_268,"There is no link.
"
p240_269,"This is a question of Islam.
"
p240_270,"It looks as though he will be right.
"
p240_271,"Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
"
p240_272,"Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
"
p240_273,"Have a look at our accounts.
"
p240_274,"He was also married with two children.
"
p240_275,"And Michael was just great.
"
p240_276,"Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
"
p240_277,"Access has been a nightmare.
"
p240_278,"It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning.
"
p240_279,"It's a way of life.
"
p240_280,"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
"
p240_281,"A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
"
p240_282,"However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
"
p240_283,"People have no choice.
"
p240_284,"In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
"
p240_285,"In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
"
p240_286,"If not, he should go home.
"
p240_288,"His mother refuses to believe that she is dead.
"
p240_289,"Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
"
p240_290,"This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
"
p240_291,"Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
"
p240_292,"He will address the nation this evening.
"
p240_293,"It was a virus.
"
p240_294,"Maloney is an engaging talent.
"
p240_295,"The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
"
p240_296,"It's like a high school play.
"
p240_297,"Who did the recruiting?
"
p240_298,"He was obviously very genuine.
"
p240_299,"She said she could not believe that they had run away.
"
p240_300,"Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
"
p240_301,"A new school will be built.
"
p240_302,"We have to sort it out ourselves.
"
p240_303,"He said she was mad.
"
p240_304,"I was the sheep.
"
p240_305,"There was no hint of scandal.
"
p240_306,"The home was now under new management.
"
p240_307,"The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
"
p240_308,"We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
"
p240_309,"In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
"
p240_310,"We do not expect any surplus.
"
p240_311,"The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
"
p240_312,"The plot is minimal.
"
p240_313,"And he goes with it.
"
p240_314,"SCOTLAND has shown the way.
"
p240_315,"It is no surprise.
"
p240_316,"Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
"
p240_317,"The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
"
p240_318,"They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
"
p240_319,"They were fantastic.
"
p240_320,"There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
"
p240_321,"We are a peaceful people.
"
p240_322,"The election is total confusion and chaos.
"
p240_323,"Henman has been warned.
"
p240_324,"Craig is a major concern for us.
"
p240_325,"It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
"
p240_326,"It is out there.
"
p240_327,"Referees are easy targets.
"
p240_328,"They had a confession.
"
p240_329,"We do the same.
"
p240_330,"That's the law of the land.
"
p240_331,"Donald was his friend.
"
p240_332,"I am so upset.
"
p240_333,"They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
"
p240_334,"Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
"
p240_335,"The police have to act to help them.
"
p240_336,"We agreed to disagree.
"
p240_337,"It could have gone either way.
"
p240_338,"He was then replaced by Ross.
"
p240_339,"I saw some good things.
"
p240_340,"I've not thought about it.
"
p240_341,"Who was the mystery MP?
"
p240_342,"In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
"
p240_343,"It is a sign of hope.
"
p240_344,"Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
"
p240_345,"Three years ago he would have been.
"
p240_346,"Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
"
p240_347,"It is so unfair.
"
p240_348,"They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
"
p240_349,"He has to learn.
"
p240_351,"Look at the witnesses.
"
p240_352,"That is the very reason why it was so vital.
"
