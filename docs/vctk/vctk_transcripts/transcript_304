p304_001,Please call Stella.
p304_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p304_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p304_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p304_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p304_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p304_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p304_008,"These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p304_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p304_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p304_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p304_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p304_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p304_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p304_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p304_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p304_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p304_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p304_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p304_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p304_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p304_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p304_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p304_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p304_025,So we will cut their numbers.
p304_026,Who cares about that?
p304_027,Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p304_028,Glasgow is going to be open for business.
p304_029,I know my job.
p304_030,The likelihood is that it will be negative.
p304_031,"In fact, we were all over the shop."
p304_032,Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p304_033,They agree to meet.
p304_034,"SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts."
p304_035,But there was a heavy price to pay.
p304_036,The most important thing was to win today.
p304_037,We have a strong team at the moment.
p304_038,At half-time you have?
p304_039,The butcher is very good.
p304_040,He is dying from cancer.
p304_041,"However, they will only be found in the wild."
p304_042,It was an ambush.
p304_043,"For these people, the ruling is very welcome."
p304_044,Scottish sport was not mentioned.
p304_045,I was doing a charity concert.
p304_046,You have to have a sense of humour.
p304_047,It is not about changing our image.
p304_048,We are waiting for advice on the film.
p304_049,I hadn't been looking after myself.
p304_050,"His father said, My son was lucky."
p304_051,But they also came with a downside.
p304_052,She was only doing her job.
p304_053,"Are you listening, All Saints?"
p304_054,And then came the seventies.
p304_055,I guess it is down to focus.
p304_056,I'm very angry about it.
p304_057,I have great respect for all my players.
p304_058,His track record is not promising.
p304_059,For a moment it was all about her.
p304_060,"Sadly, the game will never see his like again."
p304_061,Trading Places was too obvious.
p304_062,They don't know how to do it.
p304_063,No details were disclosed.
p304_064,Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p304_065,"If you can get away with it, you do it."
p304_066,First is open defiance.
p304_067,You probably have never seen them before.
p304_068,"Clearly, audiences are unsettled."
p304_069,We have avoided that at least.
p304_070,I love a clever reader.
p304_071,I do not believe they are.
p304_072,That is completely against Islam.
p304_073,"Clearly, there will have to be changes."
p304_074,Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p304_075,I will wait until later.
p304_076,"But, of course, it isn't."
p304_077,"We are almost at that point, but not quite."
p304_078,Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p304_079,Could it be?
p304_080,It is bad news for us and England.
p304_081,They had failed to explode.
p304_082,We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
p304_083,I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p304_084,Nor should there have been.
p304_085,Smoking is also very important.
p304_086,I have a theory.
p304_087,He was determined to write a novel.
p304_088,So is there anything left to say?
p304_089,My back is feeling really good.
p304_090,They've got their own agenda.
p304_091,This commitment should be built upon.
p304_092,It was one he was born to play.
p304_093,But we are losing that connection.
p304_094,He was jailed for five years.
p304_095,I am about protecting the state pension.
p304_096,We will look into it.
p304_097,But he's not afraid to take risks.
p304_098,We shouldn't have a rush to judgment.
p304_099,I live on the streets of Glasgow.
p304_100,Did you get the script?
p304_101,This is an exciting time in Scottish politics.
p304_102,"There, you were just a body."
p304_103,He will suspend it on Thursday afternoon.
p304_104,Four people died instantly.
p304_105,He did not know his daughter.
p304_106,Jim Wallace has been running the Government.
p304_107,Our children are the future of our society.
p304_108,Nine other passengers were treated at the scene.
p304_109,I can't believe it's all gone.
p304_110,I am just going to go for it.
p304_111,We will meet again.
p304_112,We are about to have our own Parliament.
p304_113,Part of the complex is historic.
p304_114,We need to chat.
p304_115,Justice was not seen today.
p304_116,Among them are many criminals.
p304_117,This is not about revenge.
p304_118,How can we ignore it?
p304_119,It's totally double standards.
p304_120,Strikers like to go to the ground.
p304_121,It's something he works hard at achieving.
p304_122,We are taking the back seat on this.
p304_123,It was a privilege to work for him.
p304_124,But he admits he is deeply upset.
p304_125,We told them in August.
p304_126,We are going to have a parade.
p304_127,That could be at least five years away.
p304_128,That is my role.
p304_129,Everyone can be bought.
p304_130,You would be a fool not to listen.
p304_131,No other offers apply.
p304_132,Have you noticed?
p304_133,This is a wonderful honour for me.
p304_134,The Lobby is not failing.
p304_135,It was a takeover.
p304_136,That statement has never been withdrawn.
p304_137,Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p304_138,How many cases have there been?
p304_139,But we have to plan for the future.
p304_140,And yet his legacy is doubtful.
p304_141,This advice was accepted by ministers.
p304_142,That's a pretty good percentage.
p304_143,I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
p304_144,I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p304_145,You have to think not.
p304_146,This is a total mystery.
p304_147,They were due to have begun today.
p304_148,Do not listen to them.
p304_149,So what makes it so special?
p304_150,It will be easier for us.
p304_151,I'm pleased for him.
p304_152,The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
p304_153,You need a trademark.
p304_154,This is our Olympics.
p304_155,Things are looking pretty positive at the moment.
p304_156,The tournament has now been cancelled.
p304_157,My goal was very important to the team.
p304_158,There are plenty examples.
p304_159,This is not a Scottish problem.
p304_160,They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p304_161,I have worked with him on projects.
p304_162,It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
p304_163,It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p304_164,And there is no cause for it.
p304_165,I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
p304_166,What has changed?
p304_167,Manchester United were still trying up to yesterday.
p304_168,It is a symbolic concert.
p304_169,He asked me how they were doing.
p304_170,They would have looked out for each other.
p304_171,I've got three other ideas for the day.
p304_172,"Well it had to be something, that's for sure."
p304_174,"On Saturday, it was much the same."
p304_175,I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p304_176,The result today is an impasse.
p304_177,Nelson does not disappoint.
p304_178,"Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile."
p304_179,The real world is full of competing causes.
p304_180,They've got to decide to do that.
p304_181,Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
p304_182,These are terrible offences.
p304_183,This is it finally finished.
p304_184,An announcement is expected today on their future.
p304_185,There were so many characters among them.
p304_186,Or is it the European approach?
p304_187,We could not get any possession.
p304_188,Did you see that?
p304_189,The cost of war is more than that.
p304_190,I saw the whole thing.
p304_191,There is a demand for another hospice.
p304_192,There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p304_193,Then they were awarded a penalty.
p304_194,Journalists should make him.
p304_195,They will have five minutes to decide.
p304_196,I see that any day now.
p304_197,But who knows?
p304_198,He was tough and relentless.
p304_199,That would be unlawful.
p304_200,This guy is amazing.
p304_201,The same goes for McKenna.
p304_202,That is no use.
p304_203,They will want to perform well.
p304_204,We should not worry about other players.
p304_205,Ownership was the game.
p304_206,"Their moment had come, or so they said."
p304_207,I love the moment of being first.
p304_208,Some examples are presented in detail.
p304_209,You cannot understand it until you experience it.
p304_210,"Anything that can be done, the Government will do."
p304_211,I sincerely hope that will not change.
p304_212,Just don't go looking to be shocked.
p304_213,It was total confusion.
p304_214,I have learned from him.
p304_215,Pupils will be the losers.
p304_216,The position on the euro remains unchanged.
p304_217,Such actions are rarely popular.
p304_218,That is why it is so lyrical.
p304_219,It isn't a happy memory.
p304_220,A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p304_221,Who would be a referee?
p304_222,We have a team to reach the final.
p304_223,We want to be separate from our neighbours.
p304_224,He was correct in everything he did.
p304_225,I see no reason for them to be.
p304_226,I never agreed with that.
p304_227,He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
p304_228,I don't think it is vital.
p304_229,But he insisted that victory was possible.
p304_230,That could run into millions.
p304_231,It might not survive the process.
p304_232,"The truth is, it is somewhere in the middle."
p304_233,I'm really excited about the album.
p304_234,We were desperate to get the game on.
p304_235,But there is a possible place.
p304_236,You can't have it both ways.
p304_237,"Offered the gold medal, he declined."
p304_238,But they will need to play to score.
p304_239,He is a joy to watch.
p304_240,They also have good neighbours.
p304_241,We are now open.
p304_242,She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p304_243,There is no pressure from anyone now.
p304_244,Now it has become a big picture.
p304_245,We want to learn lessons from that.
p304_246,He can perform well under pressure.
p304_247,I've enjoyed the whole experience.
p304_248,He was totally without that form of fear.
p304_249,"The band was good, and it's been a great day."
p304_250,ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p304_251,They have the cash to do that.
p304_252,This is a defining moment in this parliament.
p304_253,He wouldn't have played in all three.
p304_254,And that includes the Barnett formula.
p304_255,It is a great shame.
p304_256,But experts have disputed that statistic.
p304_257,The council has been open and transparent.
p304_258,I'll never think of myself as a star.
p304_259,I felt he was excellent.
p304_260,It was a policy they were against.
p304_261,The results are sometimes contentious.
p304_262,I believe that Scotland has much to gain.
p304_263,People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p304_264,Had she enjoyed the experience?
p304_265,He has changed the country itself.
p304_266,The look on his face was something special.
p304_267,I can certainly see much better.
p304_268,We then went to see the headmaster.
p304_269,I needed a little man in the crowd.
p304_270,It would then be up to the judge.
p304_271,Are we going to stay up?
p304_272,People were actually not on his side.
p304_273,It was a very difficult period.
p304_274,It's all going to clear the debt.
p304_275,It used to be less than five minutes.
p304_276,It was by the numbers.
p304_277,My Dad is a hero.
p304_278,It is my fault.
p304_279,We are not asking for the moon.
p304_280,That used to be another thing of mine.
p304_281,At the election we will oppose the euro.
p304_282,As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
p304_283,Teachers have been given the offer.
p304_284,He called for a public inquiry.
p304_285,I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p304_286,"I played badly, but it happens."
p304_287,I have got a wife to feed.
p304_288,I lost my head.
p304_289,What are the barriers?
p304_290,He is keen to stay in public service.
p304_291,You are not going in blind.
p304_292,You had to go and see him.
p304_293,She says she has grown up.
p304_294,He met his wife and married in England.
p304_295,But it could have been written for her.
p304_296,It makes no sense.
p304_297,What will they called?
p304_298,"We come here in peace, for peace."
p304_299,He will feel the pain again.
p304_300,"After New Labour, we now have New Unionists."
p304_301,I can't stand this sort of stuff.
p304_302,Is Saddam a threat?
p304_303,The jury is still out.
p304_304,"Hopefully, they will not go through with it."
p304_305,I can't say that this is very usual.
p304_306,"He is married, with two children."
p304_307,"At Riverside, the rematch was totally different."
p304_308,We are the gateway to justice.
p304_309,"As in battle, the worst thing is waiting for it."
p304_310,We understand the changes in the world.
p304_311,It is a potential factor.
p304_312,The working families tax credit is far better.
p304_313,It added to the reverence.
p304_314,It is too early to say.
p304_315,It's to do with context.
p304_316,David Trimble has sold out.
p304_317,Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p304_318,I don't understand it.
p304_319,The teenager had been missing for six months.
p304_320,He was rejected because he had retired.
p304_321,And then we got off the plane.
p304_322,I think it is wide open.
p304_323,I am totally surprised.
p304_324,We are all ecstatic.
p304_325,I hope he has learned from it.
p304_326,"That doesn't just happen, you have to build it."
p304_327,You are a gambling man.
p304_328,Who honestly expected anything else?
p304_329,The search has been called off.
p304_330,The matter will come up again.
p304_331,Our strategy is straightforward.
p304_332,Surely this is not supposed to happen?
p304_333,We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p304_334,They were unable to revive him.
p304_335,This has come as a shock to everyone.
p304_336,"Yes, it was too short a night."
p304_337,"It is not for me, though."
p304_338,It really was my favourite.
p304_339,That is why this action has been taken.
p304_340,They should be looking at his victims.
p304_341,There were many positives for this club.
p304_342,"It's all about money, money, money."
p304_343,There wasn't anything in it.
p304_344,What do we do for an encore?
p304_345,Things start to talk to each other.
p304_346,I would like to stay with Rangers.
p304_347,Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p304_348,Thirty people have applied for his job!
p304_349,That is a lot of writing.
p304_350,There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
p304_351,It is no place for a poet.
p304_352,There is room for me.
p304_353,My life is in the ballet.
p304_354,"For next season, we have time to restructure."
p304_355,"The truth, of course, is very different."
p304_356,He has something in common with the Wallabies.
p304_357,These will take a little time to develop.
p304_358,This is not a birthday party.
p304_359,"Darren is very, very good."
p304_360,It's a drop in the bucket.
p304_361,"I've had a hard time, to be honest."
p304_362,I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
p304_363,She is still very poorly.
p304_364,That's how she wants to remember him.
p304_365,There was no disruption to services.
p304_366,We talk about effective military action.
p304_367,It was a discussion paper.
p304_368,My neighbours are horrified.
p304_369,He had no problem with alcohol.
p304_370,This was a very tragic accident.
p304_371,"If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere."
p304_372,It is the voice of the survivors.
p304_373,I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
p304_374,I wish him well.
p304_375,Only the details have to be sorted out.
p304_376,They say they feel different.
p304_377,We are in the hat.
p304_378,"Well, what can you do?"
p304_379,Motorists will welcome this.
p304_380,It is not the message alone.
p304_381,She failed to win any of them.
p304_382,He is at war with his knee.
p304_383,I think we're going to make it.
p304_384,I didn't know where they were.
p304_385,Clubs can only do so much.
p304_386,Many other areas are coming up.
p304_387,But it's a subtle process.
p304_388,But let's not go down that road.
p304_389,It is not attempting to offer a solution.
p304_390,Changes need to be made.
p304_391,I don't care to recall it.
p304_392,That's the way things are heading.
p304_393,Hard it will be.
p304_394,He just attracted people.
p304_395,It was better than a soap opera.
p304_396,I doubt it would be genuine.
p304_397,You must be ready to play anyone.
p304_398,It would have been a very explosive issue.
p304_399,It seems a waste of talents.
p304_400,It is the worst of both worlds.
p304_401,We need to tighten up.
p304_402,His body was never found.
p304_403,Just get on with your job.
p304_404,We expect a full house on the night.
p304_405,He said it was his greatest work.
p304_406,The baby deserves the credit.
p304_407,They are different types.
p304_408,"Like everything in Scotland, it takes time."
p304_409,We are not too surprised.
p304_410,They are not a set of options.
p304_411,But it was money well spent.
p304_412,They would never let him go.
p304_413,Which is worse?
p304_414,"At the end of the day, one has to be careful."
p304_415,Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
p304_416,He took over our lives.
p304_417,I would think they are just behind them.
p304_418,We would all have liked to run.
p304_419,I can understand why they have gone.
p304_420,"That, though, was then."
p304_421,People should not become complacent.
p304_422,I will go out with him any time.
p304_423,I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p304_424,Public safety is paramount.
