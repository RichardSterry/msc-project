p274_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
"

"
p274_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
"
p274_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
"
p274_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
"
p274_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
"
p274_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. )
"
p274_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
"
p274_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways. )
"
p274_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
"
p274_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
"
p274_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
"
p274_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
"
p274_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. )
"
p274_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
"
p274_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
"
p274_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
"
p274_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
"
p274_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. )
"
p274_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
"
p274_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
