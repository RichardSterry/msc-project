p258_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p258_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p258_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p258_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p258_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p258_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p258_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p258_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p258_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p258_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p258_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p258_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p258_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p258_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p258_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p258_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p258_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p258_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p258_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p258_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p258_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p258_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p258_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p258_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p258_025,"Johnson was pretty low.
"
p258_026,"It's nice to hear.
"
p258_027,"People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
"
p258_028,"They should be so lucky.
"
p258_029,"Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
"
p258_030,"However, the following year the cancer returned.
"
p258_031,"Because we do not need it.
"
p258_032,"He took me on a tour of the wards.
"
p258_033,"They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
"
p258_034,"I'd like to continue that record.
"
p258_035,"It was clear.
"
p258_036,"It is not for any other purpose.
"
p258_037,"President Bush is at war.
"
p258_038,"I was scared.
"
p258_039,"It will come all right.
"
p258_040,"It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
"
p258_041,"The judge said.
"
p258_042,"We need to chat.
"
p258_043,"It's a blessing.
"
p258_044,"As she explains.
"
p258_045,"She looked so young.
"
p258_046,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p258_047,"It is the whole package.
"
p258_048,"I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
"
p258_049,"We were surprised to see the photograph.
"
p258_050,"That's the day job.
"
p258_051,"We have not given up hope.
"
p258_052,"You must have a government and a good civil service.
"
p258_053,"That is very hard, alone.
"
p258_054,"It's that kind of place.
"
p258_055,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p258_056,"And if he hadn't become a musician?
"
p258_057,"He was popular.
"
p258_058,"It should be devolved.
"
p258_059,"We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
"
p258_060,"Try to save us.
"
p258_061,"He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
"
p258_062,"Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
"
p258_063,"There is an element of racism in Scotland.
"
p258_064,"That was the easy election.
"
p258_065,"It's all I can do.
"
p258_066,"The price cuts are really exciting.
"
p258_067,"Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
"
p258_068,"The girls are so lucky to be alive.
"
p258_069,"The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
"
p258_070,"I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
"
p258_071,"He got the same story.
"
p258_072,"This is the way things should be handled.
"
p258_073,"It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
"
p258_074,"It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
"
p258_075,"However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
"
p258_076,"I first met him last summer.
"
p258_077,"Last week, he was taken into hospital.
"
p258_078,"Nothing is yet confirmed.
"
p258_079,"New Zealand rugby is totally different.
"
p258_080,"We have other options.
"
p258_081,"Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
"
p258_082,"The city council is a major property owner in the area.
"
p258_083,"Today I couldn't run on it.
"
p258_084,"They are different types.
"
p258_085,"It is a simple equation.
"
p258_086,"Until you hit the big games.
"
p258_087,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p258_088,"There was no rescue.
"
p258_089,"She's got to say something.
"
p258_090,"The selection process is still at a very early stage.
"
p258_091,"Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
"
p258_092,"Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
"
p258_093,"Journalists should make him.
"
p258_094,"But it was a pleasure.
"
p258_095,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p258_096,"Oil embargo endorsed.
"
p258_097,"It is a good lifestyle.
"
p258_098,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p258_099,"Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
"
p258_100,"It's not perfect.
"
p258_101,"They had to be cut from the wreckage.
"
p258_102,"She has been shot.
"
p258_103,"He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
"
p258_104,"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
"
p258_105,"We do not expect any surplus.
"
p258_106,"He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
"
p258_107,"It is so sad.
"
p258_108,"We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
"
p258_109,"We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
"
p258_110,"This film will be totally awesome.
"
p258_111,"Maybe this battle has been.
"
p258_112,"Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
"
p258_113,"I joined a group.
"
p258_114,"This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
"
p258_115,"Who would have?
"
p258_116,"It is a delight on every level.
"
p258_117,"You can spend money on housing.
"
p258_118,"Here, again, they were denied a voice.
"
p258_119,"Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
"
p258_120,"There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
"
p258_121,"I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
"
p258_122,"It has removed a bit of guilt.
"
p258_123,"She does not want to speak.
"
p258_124,"It's terrible that he has died the same way.
"
p258_125,"So the European elections are extremely important.
"
p258_126,"Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
"
p258_127,"Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
"
p258_128,"Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
"
p258_129,"The move has provoked a mixed response.
"
p258_130,"The role was perfect for Russell.
"
p258_131,"It plans to return to this field.
"
p258_132,"They made such decisions in London.
"
p258_133,"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
"
p258_134,"My conscience is not clear.
"
p258_135,"I am totally devoted to this job.
"
p258_136,"He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
"
p258_137,"If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
"
p258_138,"We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
"
p258_139,"Is that Titanic?
"
p258_140,"He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
"
p258_141,"Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
"
p258_142,"It opens the door to the Champions League.
"
p258_143,"You know the type.
"
p258_144,"The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
"
p258_145,"The FBI could become involved.
"
p258_146,"The weather forecast isn't good.
"
p258_147,"She had gone to the Catholic school.
"
p258_148,"My Dad is a hero.
"
p258_149,"The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
"
p258_150,"Neither side can win this war.
"
p258_151,"Was this element always there?
"
p258_152,"These days are long gone.
"
p258_153,"I've put my own money into this project.
"
p258_154,"They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
"
p258_155,"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
"
p258_156,"They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
"
p258_157,"Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
"
p258_158,"We have to move forward.
"
p258_159,"Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
"
p258_160,"We try to keep it right.
"
p258_161,"It's that sort of night.
"
p258_162,"I lost my head.
"
p258_163,"It is not too late to get on board.
"
p258_164,"Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
"
p258_165,"That will do for me.
"
p258_166,"They thought they had found a home.
"
p258_167,"I always felt they played for me.
"
p258_168,"Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
"
p258_169,"First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
"
p258_170,"IT S the real thing, for sure.
"
p258_171,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p258_172,"If that's the case, he will struggle.
"
p258_173,"It should be easy.
"
p258_174,"There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
"
p258_175,"I drove the ball well.
"
p258_176,"Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
"
p258_177,"I've been there.
"
p258_178,"They will run a mile.
"
p258_179,"Four policemen were wounded.
"
p258_180,"They receive a high profile in the media.
"
p258_181,"We did everything by the book.
"
p258_182,"The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
"
p258_183,"He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
"
p258_184,"We want to help them through it.
"
p258_185,"It is a terrible loss.
"
p258_186,"We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
"
p258_187,"The procedure is the same in all cases.
"
p258_188,"If the director is with you.
"
p258_189,"It's very difficult to find a buyer.
"
p258_190,"I grew up listening to these people.
"
p258_191,"The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
"
p258_192,"It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
"
p258_193,"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
"
p258_194,"It's the same old story.
"
p258_195,"It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
"
p258_196,"Is that success?
"
p258_197,"Ferguson should take note.
"
p258_198,"They've got three-quarters of the way.
"
p258_199,"But she might be.
"
p258_200,"A deadline is still essential.
"
p258_201,"We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
"
p258_202,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p258_203,"It's a mixture of everything.
"
p258_204,"After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
"
p258_205,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p258_206,"The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
"
p258_207,"Feel the heat?
"
p258_208,"He is slightly confused.
"
p258_209,"She should not be blamed.
"
p258_210,"Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
"
p258_211,"It had all been arranged.
"
p258_212,"A Grampian Police spokesman said.
"
p258_213,"His third goal was superb.
"
p258_214,"It's not ideal.
"
p258_215,"We want to keep the pound.
"
p258_216,"I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
"
p258_217,"He seemed to lose his focus.
"
p258_218,"I might come back.
"
p258_219,"His death was a tragic accident.
"
p258_220,"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
"
p258_221,"He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
"
p258_222,"Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
"
p258_223,"It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
"
p258_224,"It's so special.
"
p258_225,"The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
"
p258_226,"What was the main difference?
"
p258_227,"It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
"
p258_228,"I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
"
p258_229,"They are the innocent victims.
"
p258_230,"My wife and family are the support system.
"
p258_231,"Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
"
p258_232,"They tried to give her advice.
"
p258_233,"They had no children.
"
p258_234,"We are in the hat.
"
p258_235,"They should come forward.
"
p258_236,"Well, they were the unlucky ones.
"
p258_237,"It's quite nice.
"
p258_238,"Hospitals are for the ill.
"
p258_239,"The problem in Norway is outside the National.
"
p258_240,"Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
"
p258_241,"They are all bright and different.
"
p258_242,"It is hard won.
"
p258_243,"It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
"
p258_244,"Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
"
p258_245,"You can feel at home in China.
"
p258_246,"It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
"
p258_247,"It's a record label, not a form of music.
"
p258_248,"I was shocked.
"
p258_249,"I should think so, too.
"
p258_250,"We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
"
p258_251,"I didn't need to watch it on the video.
"
p258_252,"He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
"
p258_253,"Her presence was almost everywhere.
"
p258_254,"We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
"
p258_255,"Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
"
p258_256,"He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
"
p258_257,"They are interior designers and architects.
"
p258_258,"Chelsea was a great club.
"
p258_259,"It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
"
p258_260,"I was in jail for five years.
"
p258_261,"I am very angry.
"
p258_262,"They must play for each other.
"
p258_263,"Today we can say that a new era has begun.
"
p258_264,"It is also very valuable.
"
p258_265,"He thought he had a month to cross the street.
"
p258_266,"It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
"
p258_267,"I saw one body.
"
p258_268,"That's the only thing I will say.
"
p258_269,"Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
"
p258_270,"The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
"
p258_271,"Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
"
p258_272,"Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
"
p258_273,"Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
"
p258_274,"It is the same in Sweden.
"
p258_275,"Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
"
p258_276,"Our objective is to tackle poverty.
"
p258_277,"They were all in a stable condition last night.
"
p258_278,"It's a way of life.
"
p258_279,"The record companies have gone through the floor.
"
p258_280,"He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
"
p258_281,"He has a wealth of experience.
"
p258_282,"It's so awful.
"
p258_283,"For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
"
p258_284,"I intended to look for another club on loan.
"
p258_285,"Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
"
p258_286,"This is a national crisis.
"
p258_287,"The death toll included five children.
"
p258_288,"He was obviously very genuine.
"
p258_289,"It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
"
p258_290,"It was deployed in the Gulf War.
"
p258_291,"The results are sometimes contentious.
"
p258_292,"These figures are truly awful.
"
p258_293,"It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
"
p258_294,"Sunday's game was not a trial.
"
p258_295,"A new school will be built.
"
p258_296,"The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
"
p258_297,"Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.

p258_298,"The home was now under new management.
"
p258_299,"Graeme was prepared.
"
p258_300,"In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
"
p258_301,"Nothing is safe.
"
p258_302,"One was a lawyer.
"
p258_303,"A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
"
p258_304,"The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
"
p258_305,"Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
"
p258_306,"This is a war over our home.
"
p258_307,"In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
"
p258_308,"Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
"
p258_309,"It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
"
p258_310,"It's certainly different.
"
p258_311,"The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
"
p258_312,"He will go a long way.
"
p258_313,"We want to play at the worlds.
"
p258_314,"Scotland were beaten again.
"
p258_315,"They were fantastic.
"
p258_316,"There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
"
p258_317,"Kids are terrible.
"
p258_318,"It should be equal.
"
p258_319,"The problems began a long time ago.
"
p258_320,"My body is clearly capable.
"
p258_321,"Referees are easy targets.
"
p258_322,"He said she was mad.
"
p258_323,"It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
"
p258_324,"Davis is very supportive, as a director.
"
p258_325,"However, the groups denied the claims.
"
p258_326,"There was some merit in that.
"
p258_327,"I came into this world with nothing.
"
p258_328,"It is a strong case.
"
p258_329,"They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
"
p258_330,"Off with their heads.
"
p258_331,"I am so upset.
"
p258_332,"I'd like to take the plunge.
"
p258_333,"Robert is a special talent.
"
p258_334,"Finally, he paid for the movie.
"
p258_335,"There was no option.
"
p258_336,"They haven't got a hope.
"
p258_337,"He did a good job.
"
p258_338,"I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
"
p258_339,"It was so new, so exciting.
"
p258_340,"They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
"
p258_341,"Indeed, it was magical.
"
p258_342,"I've got no secret.
"
p258_343,"There's no place to hide.
"
p258_344,"Tiger is the exception.
"
p258_345,"Nobody else was with me.
"
p258_346,"That is the very reason why it was so vital.
"
p258_347,"The composer will conduct.
"
p258_348,"His contract was then not renewed.
"
p258_349,"I got a yellow card.
"
p258_350,"It is long gone.
