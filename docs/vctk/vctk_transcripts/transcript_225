p225_001,"Please call Stella.
"
p225_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
"
p225_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
"
p225_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
"
p225_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
"
p225_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
"
p225_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
"
p225_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
"
p225_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
"
p225_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it.
"
p225_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
"
p225_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
"
p225_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
"
p225_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
"
p225_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
"
p225_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
"
p225_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
"
p225_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
"
p225_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
"
p225_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
"
p225_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
"
p225_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
"
p225_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p225_025,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p225_026,"How are you, sir ?
"
p225_027,"So is that it, then ?
"
p225_028,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p225_029,"What do we do ?
"
p225_030,"People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
"
p225_033,"It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
"
p225_035,"A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
"
p225_036,"It was a close call.
"
p225_037,"In fact, they are the future of investment.
"
p225_038,"Diving is no part of football.
"
p225_039,"However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
"
p225_040,"You'd better believe it.
"
p225_044,"It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
"
p225_045,"People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
"
p225_046,"No details of the talks were given.
"
p225_049,"I have learned from him.
"
p225_051,"We are committed to the ban.
"
p225_052,"Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
"
p225_053,"I have made that offer.
"
p225_054,"Four other charges were dropped.
"
p225_056,"Clearly, it can go either way.
"
p225_057,"However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
"
p225_058,"However, the problem is the timing.
"
p225_059,"But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
"
p225_060,"Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
"
p225_061,"Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
"
p225_062,"I was very pleased with them today, though.
"
p225_063,"Both sides have been hit by injury.
"
p225_064,"It could take some time.
"
p225_065,"There is no pressure on us.
"
p225_066,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p225_067,"Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
"
p225_070,"That is bound to happen.
"
p225_071,"He is in the queue.
"
p225_072,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p225_073,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p225_081,"I had no intention of misleading anyone.
"
p225_082,"That view is held by many others within the industry.
"
p225_083,"Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
"
p225_084,"He is delighted, and he has every right to be.
"
p225_086,"In fact, he should never have been in the field.
"
p225_089,"Officers recovered a second body in the area.
"
p225_090,"I did not have a bet on myself.
"
p225_092,"There is a contract in existence for Allan.
"
p225_094,"That's as it should be.
"
p225_103,"Everyone deserves to share in this success.
"
p225_104,"His is a success story by any standard.
"
p225_108,"Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
"
p225_109,"That might help a bit.
"
p225_110,"Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
"
p225_111,"It isn't a happy memory.
"
p225_113,"The big issue for us is the review.
"
p225_114,"I told him I was a long time ago.
"
p225_115,"Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
"
p225_116,"Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
"
p225_117,"We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.
"
p225_118,"We suffered a lot for seven years.
"
p225_120,"The industry is not well organised.
"
p225_121,"You get a lot for your money.
"
p225_122,"I didn't feel under any pressure.
"
p225_123,"It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
"
p225_124,"As for the warning, it was not needed.
"
p225_126,"The squad is too small.
"
p225_127,"It is a common problem.
"
p225_128,"Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
"
p225_131,"Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
"
p225_133,"I think he's the favourite.
"
p225_135,"We have seen a copy of the report.
"
p225_136,"But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
"
p225_141,"Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
"
p225_142,"Well, you can have a tree.
"
p225_143,"Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
"
p225_144,"She will do for me.
"
p225_145,"Why change it ?
"
p225_147,"Does the name matter ?
"
p225_149,"Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
"
p225_150,"But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
"
p225_151,"Nothing has been put into action.
"
p225_152,"The weather forecast isn't good.
"
p225_153,"We have a clean bill of health.
"
p225_156,"I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
"
p225_157,"He was asked to quit.
"
p225_158,"Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
"
p225_159,"Neither side can win this war.
"
p225_165,"The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
"
p225_166,"Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.
"
p225_169,"Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
"
p225_171,"The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.
"
p225_172,"Nobody did in those days.
"
p225_173,"But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
"
p225_174,"He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
"
p225_175,"At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
"
p225_176,"Treatment is not an issue with these people.
"
p225_177,"The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
"
p225_179,"They know no other way.
"
p225_182,"We are just glad to be alive.
"
p225_191,"People will ask about us.
"
p225_192,"However, this idea is never developed.
"
p225_193,"It's very difficult to find a buyer.
"
p225_195,"It is hard to tell.
"
p225_196,"I think, therefore I am ?
"
p225_197,"Who was she ?
"
p225_199,"And they were being paid ?
"
p225_200,"It looked like a river.
"
p225_201,"The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
"
p225_202,"The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year.
"
p225_203,"They have the cash and the fire power.
"
p225_208,"You are a great player.
"
p225_210,"Scotland will play its part.
"
p225_211,"He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
"
p225_212,"After that nothing could save him.
"
p225_218,"We used to live with dignity in our country.
"
p225_219,"They did not attack the themes of the book.
"
p225_220,"He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
"
p225_221,"It's all change at Kilmarnock.
"
p225_222,"In each case they were a goal down.
"
p225_223,"The police have an awful lot to explain.
"
p225_224,"He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
"
p225_225,"It is good for our team.
"
p225_235,"I always felt that I was in control of the match.
"
p225_236,"That will be the criteria for the future.
"
p225_237,"Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
"
p225_238,"Paterson can afford to be generous.
"
p225_239,"In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
"
p225_240,"We are in the hat.
"
p225_241,"Well, they were the unlucky ones.
"
p225_242,"The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
"
p225_243,"The irony was not lost.
"
p225_244,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p225_248,"Does that put pressure on us ?
"
p225_253,"Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
"
p225_254,"The problem was a social problem.
"
p225_257,"My son was too young to die.
"
p225_258,"We were not allowed to go to help them.
"
p225_264,"That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
"
p225_265,"It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
"
p225_266,"No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
"
p225_268,"I realised I was lucky to have it.
"
p225_273,"He has not created a Festival resource.
"
p225_274,"We have not reached the point of no return.
"
p225_275,"Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
"
p225_276,"He will make an excellent chief inspector.
"
p225_277,"It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
"
p225_279,"Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
"
p225_280,"Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
"
p225_281,"They were not at the property yesterday.
"
p225_282,"It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.
"
p225_285,"We have to break that cycle.
"
p225_286,"I wanted to change the formula.
"
p225_287,"She said the charity would continue to monitor the case.
"
p225_289,"Motherwell have no such good fortune.
"
p225_290,"Scotch beef is badly missed.
"
p225_291,"We would hope to make progress on that next year.
"
p225_293,"It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
"
p225_294,"However, we had no failures in our side.
"
p225_295,"Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
"
p225_296,"It goes back a long way.
"
p225_297,"Innocent people have a right to live in safety.
"
p225_298,"It was deployed in the Gulf War.
"
p225_299,"They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
"
p225_300,"I can hardly believe it.
"
p225_301,"I must do something about it.
"
p225_302,"Three hours later, the man was free.
"
p225_303,"And it had been a marvellous occasion.
"
p225_305,"Cast Away now on general release.
"
p225_308,"I thought his speech was a disgrace.
"
p225_309,"Are they free ?
"
p225_310,"What are they for ?
"
p225_312,"Do they think anyone else wants them ?
"
p225_314,"We believe the world has too many refugees already.
"
p225_315,"The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
"
p225_316,"It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy.
"
p225_317,"At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
"
p225_318,"The problem was he thought you were a big man.
"
p225_319,"There's still a bit to go.
"
p225_320,"We have a good healthy debate.
"
p225_322,"Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
"
p225_323,"It is a court case.
"
p225_324,"There is no plan B.
"
p225_325,"The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
"
p225_326,"He will go a long way.
"
p225_328,"It is just a tax on employment.
"
p225_329,"There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
"
p225_330,"We are a peaceful people.
"
p225_331,"Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
"
p225_332,"It's difficult to predict the future.
"
p225_334,"Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
"
p225_335,"We are in the end game.
"
p225_336,"I came into this world with nothing.
"
p225_337,"But they have the sound.
"
p225_346,"It wasn't a flight of fancy.
"
p225_347,"Boy is the town a mess.
"
p225_348,"Does it matter ?
"
p225_349,"How do you take them away ?
"
p225_350,"However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
"
p225_351,"After the match, do you ?
"
p225_352,"He was then replaced by Ross.
"
p225_353,"THE pain was almost too much to bear.
"
p225_354,"This action reflects a slump in bookings.
"
p225_355,"Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
"
p225_356,"I said he was set to retire.
"
p225_357,"It is a sign of hope.
"
p225_358,"The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
"
p225_359,"But we welcome this document.
"
p225_363,"There is The Beautiful Game to write.
"
p225_365,"You did not see it.
"
p225_366,"It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
"
