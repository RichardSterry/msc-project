p305_001,Please call Stella.
p305_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p305_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p305_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p305_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p305_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p305_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p305_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p305_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p305_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p305_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p305_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p305_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p305_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p305_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p305_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p305_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p305_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p305_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p305_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p305_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p305_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p305_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p305_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p305_025,"Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey."
p305_026,"He added, however, that all options are under review."
p305_027,We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p305_028,They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p305_029,Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p305_030,It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p305_031,I'm happy to contribute to that.
p305_032,"Despite the result, it was still a great moment."
p305_033,We had a reunion last week.
p305_034,We have high hopes that this will work.
p305_035,Everyone around the club was supportive.
p305_036,People ask about the concept of a team.
p305_037,Who has he fought?
p305_038,I want a free vote.
p305_039,"He came close to signing for Rangers, too."
p305_040,It would show them a positive way forward.
p305_041,Players were held in equally low regard.
p305_042,He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p305_043,He stands on Centre Court alone.
p305_044,Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p305_045,There was a fine line to tread.
p305_046,They receive a high profile in the media.
p305_047,They were urged to get themselves in order.

p305_049,Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p305_050,But don't expect an easy ride.

p305_052,Some US embassy staff have left the country.
p305_053,Her mother said she fell off a swing.
p305_054,We see little sign of improvement.
p305_055,"The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?"
p305_056,"Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends."
p305_057,For example they could be in school uniform.
p305_058,This film will be totally awesome.
p305_059,Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
p305_060,There is no mandate for a regime change.
p305_061,He did the right thing by ignoring me.
p305_062,That tells you something about them.
p305_063,"The father was treated like a criminal, and why?"
p305_064,This rule is archaic.
p305_065,I am a drug addict.
p305_066,I've had to take time off work today.
p305_067,This wasn't just a big crowd.
p305_068,I wondered about changing back to rugby.
p305_069,Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.

p305_075,It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
p305_076,I'm so proud of my team.

p305_078,"This has not, and has been neglected."
p305_079,Waiting times for these services are too long.
p305_080,"If you're a national company, you must provide it all."
p305_081,"In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience."
p305_082,But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
p305_083,"However, it is much bigger than that."
p305_084,"This season has been great for me, it's been an experience."
p305_085,The jury is still out.
p305_086,He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p305_087,"For now, though, my future is with Rangers."
p305_088,I drove the ball well.
p305_089,"If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?"
p305_090,His handling raises a wider issue.
p305_091,This is not a recipe for conflict.
p305_092,He had done his homework properly.
p305_093,You've got it coming Kabul.
p305_094,"Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment."
p305_095,"We will have to see, but it makes you think."
p305_096,We must keep our feet on the ground.
p305_097,My grandparents were terrified.
p305_098,Are they control freaks?
p305_099,I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p305_100,They never looked like winning it either.

p305_102,No details of the talks were given.
p305_103,It is understood they saw one body.
p305_104,It was a wilful act of violence.
p305_105,"T, Is there anything in the wound?"
p305_106,"Some realism was needed about time, resources and management."
p305_107,"The research is published in the journal, Nature."
p305_108,She is a double victim.
p305_109,They make a selective perception process.
p305_110,Everything on our programme is brilliant and diverse.
p305_111,It's the way we go about it.

p305_113,Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p305_114,"We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence."
p305_115,Each day is a new beginning.
p305_116,My daughter is an adult.
p305_117,Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p305_118,We've come from a long way back.
p305_119,A lot of things can go wrong.
p305_120,He seemed to lose his focus.
p305_121,It is a vicious circle.
p305_122,She was eight months pregnant at the time.
p305_123,There has been no delay on government orders.
p305_124,Women were mostly notable by their absence.

p305_126,"I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue."
p305_127,How do you respond to losing your child?
p305_128,Who is the employer?
p305_129,"This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?"
p305_130,McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
p305_131,"On this form, they have a real chance of going up."
p305_132,Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
p305_133,You can never have enough money.
p305_134,Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p305_135,I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
p305_136,Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
p305_137,Paterson can afford to be generous.
p305_138,Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p305_139,"They do the work, you know."
p305_140,Thus far we have received no complaints.
p305_141,I haven't made the donation yet.
p305_142,Other people also tried.
p305_143,Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
p305_144,It would have very little impact on them.
p305_145,"It would still have been a good film, but very different."
p305_146,My future is in the marathon.
p305_147,They were even being used by primary pupils.
p305_148,This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
p305_149,They chose to side with terror.
p305_150,"In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify."
p305_151,They just made me feel dizzy.
p305_152,"He must have sat down, relieved it was over."
p305_153,He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
p305_154,Health care workers and labourers followed.
p305_155,Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
p305_156,Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p305_157,We have all been shocked by her death.
p305_158,We are asking the council to think again.
p305_159,He had worked there for only two days.
p305_160,"Hopefully, now we're getting it."
p305_161,But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
p305_162,"For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up."
p305_163,They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p305_164,Scotland need to work on two key areas.
p305_165,We have already begun to do that here.
p305_166,The home team also had their moments.
p305_167,They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p305_168,"In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose."
p305_169,That is where the club has gone wrong.
p305_170,I got off to a great start.
p305_171,It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
p305_172,The actor has met with Mandela.
p305_173,Singing has gone out of fashion.

p305_175,I got on very well with Allan.
p305_176,That has given me great confidence.

p305_178,He was lying face down in the water.
p305_179,He urged people to forgive.
p305_180,So he is open to ideas.
p305_181,Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
p305_182,"Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art."
p305_183,We are expected to do better than before.
p305_184,The attacker died in the crash.
p305_185,I am not even thinking about that.
p305_186,Angola was a really hard place.
p305_187,It is giving out the wrong message.
p305_188,"It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike."
p305_189,The sleeper was six hours late.
p305_190,Tax is a matter for national governments.
p305_191,We want to keep the pound.

p305_193,He needed seven hours of surgery.
p305_194,"Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages."
p305_195,It just came into my head that day.
p305_196,Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p305_197,"They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives."
p305_198,I am saddened to hear of the accident.
p305_199,"Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game."
p305_200,He would help me with the form.
p305_201,The actors just have to say so.
p305_202,The minister is the engineer.
p305_203,I think it was briefly considered.
p305_204,It's a hidden problem.
p305_205,I lost a part of me.
p305_206,"Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round."
p305_207,"It's part of the game, isn't it?"
p305_208,I believe in the Church.
p305_209,Others were even less confident.
p305_210,It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
p305_211,So people will come out with these things.
p305_212,You may have a short memory.
p305_213,My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p305_214,The whole thing is utterly transparent.
p305_215,Every game against New Zealand is.
p305_216,That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
p305_217,"He takes his time, and won't be rushed."
p305_218,It shows that painting is still relevant.
p305_219,Then there's one where people play for fun.
p305_220,"It may be his last for a while, too."
p305_221,They have enough intrusion at the time.
p305_222,Then one night only three people turn up.
p305_223,"The parents will have a great time, too."
p305_224,Now we see the impact of global politics.
p305_225,Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
p305_226,Appointments should be made on merit.
p305_227,There have been a lot of lessons learned.
p305_228,I think we will join the single currency.
p305_229,Gilbert was not amused.
p305_230,Everything was up for grabs.
p305_231,"I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament."
p305_232,There will not be any charges.
p305_233,Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p305_234,Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p305_235,I think we have a very strong case.
p305_236,"It should be a great game, though."
p305_237,"You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals."
p305_238,"Usually, you should leave it alone in the box."
p305_239,So the process was refined.
p305_240,"I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me."
p305_241,I have been here for only three months.
p305_242,"They were not doing it too well, either."
p305_243,"He added, It's not a racial problem."
p305_244,We hope this scheme will change that.
p305_245,How could anyone take issue with that?
p305_246,The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p305_247,They were at her bedside when she died.
p305_248,They had had time for little else.
p305_249,We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p305_250,"In addition, it was in breach of natural justice."
p305_251,She did not attend the courtroom.
p305_252,"In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key."
p305_253,The composer therefore believes he can do it.
p305_254,I still feel like a wee boy.
p305_255,He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p305_256,But there was a shift.
p305_257,Israel has done very little until now.
p305_258,Debate was impassioned and furious.
p305_259,The death rates are still as high.
p305_260,"For one veteran, the memories remain vivid."
p305_261,We certainly will need to watch him.
p305_262,I don't think it could be clearer.
p305_263,We can only go up.
p305_264,He put some colour into Scottish history.
p305_265,Our offer will remain on the table.
p305_266,He is a man who lives to work.
p305_267,The website is now being amended.
p305_268,It's an internal matter.
p305_269,"If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?"
p305_270,The breakdown was much later in her life.
p305_271,Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p305_272,"He's delighted, too, with the new premises."
p305_273,I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p305_274,"Don Hutchison, too, is a threat."
p305_275,I am now just a bit uneasy.
p305_276,"However, Sharon rejected the claims."
p305_277,They married in August last year.
p305_278,Yet he chose to do something different.
p305_279,"He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy."
p305_280,The case will now go to appeal.
p305_281,They really did a great job.
p305_282,Our nation has been changed by this event.
p305_283,It was worth a photograph.
p305_284,I love you so very much.
p305_285,The road was closed for several hours.
p305_286,"In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds."
p305_287,Surrey police said no body had been found.
p305_288,My aim is a top six finish.
p305_289,We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p305_290,Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p305_291,I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p305_292,Most of the public are behind me.
p305_293,It really is a gift to the world.
p305_294,This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p305_295,My house was shaking at the time.
p305_296,I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p305_297,This is a very positive step forward.
p305_298,This is a huge confidence boost.
p305_299,That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p305_300,Nobody even knew it had happened.
p305_301,She is a very lucky lady.
p305_302,We've been there for seven years.
p305_303,They made a huge impression on me.
p305_304,His signature is his handwriting.
p305_305,He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p305_306,It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p305_307,The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p305_308,"It worked, up to a point."
p305_309,"One season, they might do well."
p305_310,"NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers."
p305_311,We've got a great defensive club.
p305_312,It's up to their parents to choose.
p305_313,I feel privileged to be here.
p305_314,She told me to apply for the crest.
p305_315,I think the Government should pay for that.
p305_316,It is still holding good today.
p305_317,The budget was too low for that.
p305_318,"His sister added, We expected him to be jailed."
p305_319,The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
p305_320,We cannot rely on protracted legal proceedings.
p305_321,I know the worry over Iraq.
p305_322,I just could not cope.
p305_323,We didn't know he was even out.
p305_324,Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p305_325,Here are some possible solutions.
p305_326,He made so many bad decisions.
p305_327,We are now up against it.
p305_328,"It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point."
p305_329,I would have dropped out otherwise.
p305_330,"Nato would ensure they could return home, he said."
p305_331,They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p305_332,I think he has undergone a sea change.
p305_333,One must hope not!
p305_334,The casting of her husband was an accident.
p305_335,"From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern."
p305_336,"That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?"
p305_337,"That's what it's all about, isn't it?"
p305_338,When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p305_339,"This time, there were no such rewards."
p305_340,"Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant."
p305_341,I'm just doing artwork.
p305_342,And we still have to pay his salary.
p305_343,Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p305_344,So there's a double whammy.
p305_345,I didn't have a trio.
p305_346,Their three other children had died as infants.
p305_347,We knew nothing about it.
p305_348,I am astonished by this decision.
p305_349,I hope my successor will do the same.
p305_350,We have got a full house tonight.
p305_351,Our children are our future.
p305_352,We will see how he is.
p305_353,The fans will support us.

p305_357,Now we need to keep our heads up.
p305_358,I put the drawing down.
p305_359,They feel it belongs to them.
p305_360,They must act now to tighten the rules.
p305_361,They too refused to come out and talk.
p305_362,It gave me something to focus on.
p305_363,"It's the curse of our time, irony."
p305_364,It's a source of deep concern.

p305_377,Farmers have been an endangered species.

p305_391,This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
