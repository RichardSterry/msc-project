p292_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p292_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p292_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p292_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p292_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p292_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p292_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p292_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p292_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p292_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p292_025,I was not involved in these discussions.
p292_026,"O, Is he conscious?"
p292_027,Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p292_028,They are being deported from their homes.
p292_029,IT IS the last week of rehearsals.
p292_030,I thought the game was very poor.
p292_031,"Three days later, he was killed."
p292_032,I don't expect to be here tomorrow.
p292_033,"Or it's not really for us, if you like."
p292_034,It was a deceit.
p292_035,You are in power.
p292_036,PR will be just one of them.
p292_037,Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
p292_038,It is just like the stock market.
p292_039,And the newspapers were full of it.
p292_040,I wish the solutions were as easy.
p292_041,She does not see anything ever changing.
p292_042,It doesn't come any better than this.
p292_043,Mr Blair should be warned.
p292_044,The idea has potential for the future.
p292_045,I did not concentrate on my performance.
p292_046,That was not due to me.
p292_047,Structural changes were also required.
p292_048,We suffered a lot for seven years.
p292_049,The racist abuse was terrible.
p292_050,What is the new religion?
p292_051,Five officers were injured.
p292_052,It was all for good reason as well.
p292_053,Fewer people are being killed in accidents.
p292_054,I'm trying not to think about that.
p292_055,Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
p292_056,I find the whole affair disturbing.
p292_057,One woman refused to sit down.
p292_058,We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p292_059,I was completely knackered.
p292_060,There are two interests in this woodland.
p292_061,A killer is also on the loose.
p292_062,"Last night, the row continued."
p292_063,Our approach will be different.
p292_064,You can see how he made his money.
p292_065,"It's really good, as long as we play well."
p292_066,We would certainly consider the proposals.
p292_067,We tend to come good at the end.
p292_068,His record with England was not good.
p292_069,"Lose, and they would be ridiculed."
p292_070,Three penalties were given.
p292_071,I didn't think they would be that stupid.
p292_072,He was between people and God.
p292_073,We are just being flooded.
p292_074,We could easily have lost that game.
p292_075,"If true, it will be the first sign of dissent."
p292_076,There were no proposals on the table.
p292_077,"It is true, but it is only part of the issue."
p292_078,THERE's only one word for it.
p292_079,It was very full anyway.
p292_080,That was him under pressure.
p292_081,I can't believe she is dead.
p292_082,I was in prison for a year.
p292_083,Among them is his beloved teacher.
p292_084,He had a really frustrating time last year.
p292_085,I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p292_086,I am constantly changing my mind.
p292_087,It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p292_088,Ending a tenancy is a last resort.
p292_089,But he just carried on anyway.
p292_090,"We should be capable of managing it, though."
p292_091,It was that kind of afternoon.
p292_092,His presence was very important.
p292_093,We are pursuing legal action against the government.
p292_094,He insisted that his staff were too.
p292_095,They should come clean.
p292_096,Let's see that increase over the years.
p292_097,"That, though, is an old story."
p292_098,The real issue is personal.
p292_099,Life becomes a song.
p292_100,It's about time something was done about equipment.
p292_101,I've learned from my mistakes.
p292_102,So far this season this approach is working.
p292_103,I have got a knife.
p292_104,"It was, for me, like a week in heaven."
p292_105,What did we learn?
p292_106,"On that basis, he would set it aside."
p292_107,"That, however, is the end of the good news."
p292_108,Seven people were later detained by police.
p292_109,It's nice to be involved.
p292_110,There could still be some to come forward.
p292_111,What are they like?
p292_112,They were back in favour with the SAC.
p292_113,The squad is too small.
p292_114,Together they will attempt to express the whole.
p292_115,I'm just going to do my best.
p292_116,"At the moment, the success in Germany is good."
p292_117,They offered to make an investment into it.
p292_118,We have no knowledge of this.
p292_119,I was influenced by all of these things.
p292_120,Is my wife a racist?
p292_121,This would not be my first choice.
p292_122,It certainly should not be used too often.
p292_123,They will run a mile.
p292_124,Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p292_125,Britain has never had it so good.
p292_126,We are under no illusions about this.
p292_127,But the killer remains at large.
p292_128,"Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people."
p292_129,He is adamant that he is innocent.
p292_130,I had a train to catch.
p292_131,It is a terrible loss.
p292_132,What's happening to her?
p292_133,It was even worse than at home.
p292_134,I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
p292_135,The plane was in flames
p292_136,We cannot lose it.
p292_137,I still think he will win.
p292_138,Elections would follow in about two years.
p292_139,"However, this idea is never developed."
p292_140,I've got to get on with my career.
p292_141,It is a road of death.
p292_142,Now we look forward to it.
p292_143,These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p292_144,We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p292_145,I have a great respect for her.
p292_146,I suggest a new plan.
p292_147,IT takes the biscuit.
p292_148,But we are not immune to the problem.
p292_149,You're not going to forget something like that.
p292_150,They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
p292_151,The result is utterly compelling.
p292_152,This is the root of their problems.
p292_153,"Other forces were, however, at work."
p292_154,He also has property interests in the country.
p292_155,That takes time and games and practice.
p292_156,If only the acting profession was that simple.
p292_157,It is a new company for Scotland.
p292_158,We should have gone solo.
p292_159,We don't even know his name.
p292_160,They have known the hard times.
p292_161,It is about the script for me.
p292_162,You cannot enter the clubhouse.
p292_163,The president will not be removed from office.
p292_164,These are serious matters.
p292_165,Are you all right at the front?
p292_166,We want to replicate that success.
p292_167,It was the first time they met.
p292_168,It's been a good year.
p292_169,"I was never alone with her, right?"
p292_170,That will be vital.
p292_171,It's a technical demand.
p292_172,It's just a normal life.
p292_173,I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p292_174,This is a very high price.
p292_175,He is the example for all of us.
p292_176,There is no way to do this.
p292_177,Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p292_178,Only one person can claim the credit.
p292_179,Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
p292_180,O Neill has delivered.
p292_181,But there was no going back.
p292_182,We will reform the welfare state.
p292_183,Progress is being made but it is slow.
p292_184,We didn't think anything would happen.
p292_185,He had come of age.
p292_186,We were a shambles at the back.
p292_187,It's not before time.
p292_188,One of these problems is the railways.
p292_189,It is a very sad day.
p292_190,A crucial moment has arrived.
p292_191,I have nothing to hide.
p292_192,"Next time round, it will be different."
p292_193,How can they get one?
p292_194,Only local people are helping.
p292_195,We had to work hard for it.
p292_196,John Lennon is a very large industry.
p292_197,This is my homeland.
p292_198,You saw the pain he was in.

p292_200,Drugs are always an issue.
p292_201,Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p292_202,"Three weeks later, he resigned."
p292_203,It has affected me.
p292_204,She made no further comment.
p292_205,I have no conflict with them.
p292_206,The next one comes up.
p292_207,She was close to suicide at one stage.
p292_208,We've got better players here.
p292_209,There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p292_210,We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p292_211,People have no chance of getting out.
p292_212,I am appalled by this news.
p292_213,We were extremely arrogant.
p292_214,"Obviously, we would want to look at this."
p292_215,I was just getting over the time difference.
p292_216,I am proud of moments like that.
p292_217,Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p292_218,No-one expected that their parents would stay.
p292_219,We're looking for unity in the council.
p292_220,The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p292_221,You cannot allow it to go on.
p292_222,It's up to the defence team.
p292_223,I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p292_224,No means testing will be required.
p292_225,He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p292_226,I don't think that's very fair.
p292_227,He was on a horse.
p292_228,Human beings are always the same.
p292_229,Then there's the problem of sympathy.
p292_230,If only he knew himself.
p292_231,This action could have been avoided.
p292_232,I watched a game.
p292_233,Anyone else can apply.
p292_234,It was like the old days.
p292_235,This was never a support group.
p292_236,The first time you read a play.
p292_237,I was a little surprised.
p292_238,This is my home town.
p292_239,That was six years ago.
p292_240,Nothing can bring back their son.
p292_241,It is up to us to approve it.

p292_246,It starts to get you down.
p292_247,We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
p292_248,My life has been turned upside down.
p292_249,The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
p292_250,I have played well the past two days.
p292_251,"I said, What was that about?"
p292_252,This could prove a problem.
p292_253,"He is an excellent defender, strong and quick."
p292_254,His game was complete.
p292_255,What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p292_256,This is too much like Scotland.
p292_257,He's been here on numerous occasions.
p292_258,That goes back a long way.
p292_259,I wouldn't have had the abandon.
p292_260,They were not at the property yesterday.
p292_261,We will not tolerate it.
p292_262,It should not make the same mistake again.
p292_263,They loved it and it showed.
p292_264,"However, by then the damage had been done."
p292_265,"As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax."
p292_266,Have we not been here before?
p292_267,Just what we didn't need.
p292_268,Inquiries are still in an early stage.
p292_269,It is a very beautiful city.
p292_270,"She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated."

p292_272,Her body was found on Monday morning.
p292_273,The issues are very intense.
p292_274,It won't be their last.
p292_275,You've got to have both sides.
p292_276,I'll tell you honestly.
p292_277,Dialogue is the key.
p292_278,It has been only average.
p292_279,He should be worried about me.
p292_280,That never happens in real life.
p292_281,I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p292_282,That was the gimmick.
p292_283,This is a national crisis.
p292_284,He has changed my life forever.
p292_285,Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p292_286,"In Europe, it is always over two games."
p292_287,There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
p292_288,"However, we had no failures in our side."
p292_289,This is his first movie.
p292_290,He already had had complaints.
p292_291,For that much we must be grateful.
p292_292,Spent three months alone at sea.
p292_293,They are the heroes.
p292_294,That will be the key to success.
p292_295,They are in good spirits.
p292_296,"Three hours later, the man was free."
p292_297,You can't get the experience in Austria.
p292_298,I wonder if Rangers do that?
p292_299,I'm going to miss it.
p292_300,The atmosphere was excellent.
p292_301,"However, the snow was welcomed by some."
p292_302,"As to rugby, well, no-one knows."
p292_303,One was a lawyer.
p292_304,Our task is to complete the picture.
p292_305,It may have been a cry for help.
p292_306,His descent was pathetic.
p292_307,By now he was very ill with cancer.
p292_308,But let's not get carried away.
p292_309,It's only tackling congestion.
p292_310,Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p292_311,We've seen that time and time again.
p292_312,Friends of the family have given their support.
p292_313,This means a great deal to the families.
p292_314,They said that they stood by their statement.
p292_315,It should be equal.
p292_316,We are on a four-year mission.
p292_317,He was always nice to me.
p292_318,Is he going to look after them?
p292_319,He had no answer.
p292_320,Scotland is too small a country for that.
p292_321,Special measures were needed.
p292_322,Your father was a good man.
p292_323,You do that because you want to win.
p292_324,The whole family was in shock.
p292_325,"This is the last chance, and everyone knows it."
p292_326,My whole life has changed.
p292_327,They always seem to produce.
p292_328,He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p292_329,But everywhere the problems are the same.
p292_330,It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p292_331,The company's in good shape.
p292_332,He became the focus of surrounding interest.
p292_333,It is out there.
p292_334,This country has many challenges.
p292_335,The best option is to destroy the plants.
p292_336,I've never had problems with any football managers.
p292_337,To begin with it looks good.
p292_338,They are with their father.
p292_339,This was a unique election.
p292_340,The review has been conducted fairly.
p292_341,They will run in tandem with New Work.
p292_342,I had to win this race.
p292_343,"And right now, it isn't there."
p292_344,The boat was fantastic.
p292_345,Donald was his friend.
p292_346,"The overall effect is impressive, but distancing."
p292_347,The girls are ready to compete.
p292_348,It gives us something to work on.
p292_349,"It was all too little, too late."
p292_350,What's the problem with change?
p292_351,Our destiny is in our own hands.
p292_352,There are moments of silence.
p292_353,Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
p292_354,The board of governors must act.
p292_355,That didn't happen for two reasons.
p292_356,It is time for a new approach.
p292_357,Now they have decided to have a rethink.
p292_358,Tiger is the exception.
p292_359,There's no choice is there?
p292_360,"Does it, Noel?"
p292_361,Do not forget about Monaco.
p292_362,You can't give in to the vandals.
p292_363,Glasgow is far from overload.
p292_364,Everything was an effort.
p292_365,And does it even matter?
p292_366,My parents are exhausted.
p292_367,"Like his acting, it was an accident."
p292_368,That's why he is a national treasure.
p292_369,I'm delighted for Andy.
p292_370,And how he kept his word.
p292_371,It's their duty to protect them.
p292_372,The Cup has come home.
p292_373,"This is a big, big win."
p292_374,"As two candidates are proposed, a vote is taken."
p292_375,That's an equally important factor.
p292_376,We were given a break.
p292_377,"It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act."
p292_378,That would have killed the match.
p292_379,That's not like us at all.
p292_380,Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
p292_381,Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p292_382,You have to rely on each other.
p292_383,Politics is a tough game.
p292_384,This season has been a nightmare.
p292_385,Everyone could see the joke.
p292_386,He is just a wonderful actor.
p292_387,Billy knew he was attracted to women.
p292_388,The occasion was a conference on Scottish art.
p292_389,Such cases are on the increase.
p292_390,This was not helpful.
p292_391,The police are not the target.
p292_392,It's a true story.
p292_393,"John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say."
p292_394,But that title is a mistake.
p292_395,"It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player."
p292_396,I'd rather have been playing.
p292_397,I am immensely sad.
p292_398,Several others were absent.
p292_399,It is surprising to come back this way.
p292_400,"Life is about people, and how you feel about people."
p292_401,Could they perhaps be related?
p292_402,We all thought we were going to die.
p292_403,I knew she was going to win.
p292_404,What is the Barnett formula?
p292_405,Clark is back on top form.
p292_406,A suspicion was not enough.
p292_407,"It will probably be my last, too."
p292_408,I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
p292_409,It is good for Europe.
p292_410,I am looking forward to this film.
p292_411,Colour was at the core of his life.
p292_412,They would not tell us.
p292_413,The balance is all wrong in this country.
p292_414,This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p292_415,It is my decision and my decision alone.
p292_416,A venue was found.
p292_417,I will always remember the horrible images.
p292_418,"It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone."
p292_419,But a surprise is in store.
p292_420,You can cope with it.
p292_421,He was back to square one.
p292_422,We didn't get any from his face.
p292_423,"But honestly, there is no need for us to panic."
p292_424,It's time for a change.
