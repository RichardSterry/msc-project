p254_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p254_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p254_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p254_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p254_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p254_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p254_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p254_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p254_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p254_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p254_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p254_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p254_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p254_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p254_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p254_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p254_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p254_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p254_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p254_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p254_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p254_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p254_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p254_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p254_025,"Johnson was pretty low.
"
p254_026,"But it failed.
"
p254_027,"They may be wrong.
"
p254_028,"I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
"
p254_029,"They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
"
p254_030,"The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
"
p254_031,"Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
"
p254_032,"So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
"
p254_033,"It's a matter of balance.
"
p254_034,"We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
"
p254_035,"Then, suddenly, they weren't.
"
p254_037,"They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
"
p254_038,"However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
"
p254_039,"They're just different.
"
p254_040,"It was clear.
"
p254_041,"It is not for any other purpose.
"
p254_042,"The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
"
p254_043,"I was scared.
"
p254_044,"However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
"
p254_045,"No meaningful response was issued.
"
p254_046,"That period was a struggle.
"
p254_047,"I am just going to go for it.
"
p254_048,"Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
"
p254_049,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p254_050,"It's a crucial award.
"
p254_051,"We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
"
p254_052,"That should do it.
"
p254_053,"It's a blessing.
"
p254_054,"Is a drug dealer?
"
p254_055,"But it might have done.
"
p254_056,"That time has passed.
"
p254_057,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p254_058,"He is too weak to move.
"
p254_059,"Life is good.
"
p254_060,"It is the whole package.
"
p254_061,"This is a club on the rise.
"
p254_062,"He had no enemies.
"
p254_063,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p254_064,"We were surprised to see the photograph.
"
p254_065,"That's the day job.
"
p254_066,"In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
"
p254_067,"This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
"
p254_068,"It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
"
p254_069,"My mother is a widow.
"
p254_070,"The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
"
p254_071,"Jobs could go.
"
p254_072,"Four other charges were dropped.
"
p254_073,"They're appalled by that.
"
p254_074,"There was a battle there.
"
p254_075,"It's good news and long overdue.
"
p254_076,"And if he hadn't become a musician?
"
p254_077,"Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
"
p254_078,"They never gave up hope.
"
p254_079,"It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
"
p254_080,"Painful, but only because it's true.
"
p254_081,"It's all I can do.
"
p254_082,"The company yesterday refused to comment.
"
p254_083,"Both sides have been hit by injury.
"
p254_084,"The price cuts are really exciting.
"
p254_085,"My office is bare.
"
p254_086,"Is there a new way forward?
"
p254_087,"There was an e-mail.
"
p254_088,"Even the one she loved.
"
p254_090,"Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
"
p254_091,"It may well have been.
"
p254_092,"However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
"
p254_093,"He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
"
p254_094,"Last week, he was taken into hospital.
"
p254_095,"He seems to be pleased with the picture.
"
p254_096,"All options are open.
"
p254_097,"You will be.
"
p254_098,"Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
"
p254_099,"And rugby fans can help.
"
p254_100,"Now the system is right behind us.
"
p254_101,"However, it did not end that way.
"
p254_102,"This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
"
p254_103,"The group is due to report by the end of the year.
"
p254_104,"I love the Dome.
"
p254_105,"Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
"
p254_106,"The selection process is still at a very early stage.
"
p254_107,"Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
"
p254_108,"However, we have not come to any conclusions.
"
p254_109,"But it was a pleasure.
"
p254_110,"He takes the job.
"
p254_111,"It was an adventure.
"
p254_112,"That all hope is never lost.
"
p254_113,"And I thought - we have to do something with this.
"
p254_114,"It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
"
p254_115,"It is normal.
"
p254_116,"I was fighting for my life, I thought.
"
p254_117,"We need to handle it.
"
p254_118,"Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
"
p254_119,"It's a long process.
"
p254_120,"They were behind the wheel.
"
p254_121,"The fire was above the hole.
"
p254_122,"This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
"
p254_123,"We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
"
p254_124,"Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
"
p254_125,"I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
"
p254_126,"I joined a group.
"
p254_127,"Does this mean.
"
p254_128,"Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
"
p254_129,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p254_130,"It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
"
p254_131,"I'm so angry.
"
p254_132,"Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
"
p254_133,"It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
"
p254_134,"They keep the atmosphere in mind.
"
p254_135,"It's terrible that he has died the same way.
"
p254_136,"The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
"
p254_137,"It plans to return to this field.
"
p254_138,"Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
"
p254_139,"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
"
p254_140,"Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
"
p254_141,"Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
"
p254_143,"I was the last man to touch the ball.
"
p254_144,"Three penalties were given.
"
p254_145,"We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
"
p254_146,"He is severe.
"
p254_147,"It is difficult for Ali.
"
p254_148,"There is a lack of chemistry.
"
p254_149,"This is the way things should be handled.
"
p254_150,"He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
"
p254_151,"Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
"
p254_152,"It is not just about pay.
"
p254_153,"Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
"
p254_154,"You know the type.
"
p254_155,"The weaknesses are few.
"
p254_156,"The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
"
p254_157,"I was in daily contact.
"
p254_158,"We will turn the corner.
"
p254_159,"This latter point is hugely important.
"
p254_160,"Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
"
p254_161,"It has been a lovely family occasion.
"
p254_162,"He's a nice guy.
"
p254_163,"It has to be now.
"
p254_164,"They are not advertised.
"
p254_165,"I have got a wife to feed.
"
p254_166,"Tell it like it was?
"
p254_167,"It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
"
p254_168,"Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
"
p254_169,"We started to struggle with each other towards the end.
"
p254_170,"Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
"
p254_171,"He was a crazy man.
"
p254_172,"They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
"
p254_173,"First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
"
p254_174,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p254_175,"It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
"
p254_176,"It is not either national standards or local control.
"
p254_177,"The clarity is vital.
"
p254_178,"The hotel was now for sale.
"
p254_179,"Tony had arrived.
"
p254_180,"He will need that machine.
"
p254_181,"I was totally wrong.
"
p254_182,"We did everything by the book.
"
p254_183,"We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
"
p254_184,"However, this idea is never developed.
"
p254_185,"I grew up listening to these people.
"
p254_186,"The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
"
p254_187,"Peace was won.
"
p254_188,"It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
"
p254_189,"I wanted to put myself on the line.
"
p254_190,"Off I went.
"
p254_191,"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
"
p254_192,"Is that it?
"
p254_193,"The conference is the first test.
"
p254_194,"On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
"
p254_195,"The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
"
p254_196,"I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
"
p254_197,"They've got three-quarters of the way.
"
p254_198,"The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
"
p254_199,"Today was first class.
"
p254_200,"We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
"
p254_201,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p254_202,"It's like a garage.
"
p254_203,"But I am a worried man.
"
p254_204,"This gives a financial incentive to switch.
"
p254_205,"That is an important part of our role.
"
p254_206,"It is a small part, and it's very small in the book.
"
p254_207,"We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
"
p254_208,"I began to pray.
"
p254_209,"A Grampian Police spokesman said.
"
p254_210,"His third goal was superb.
"
p254_211,"It's not ideal.
"
p254_212,"The FBI could become involved.
"
p254_213,"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
"
p254_214,"The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
"
p254_215,"But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
"
p254_216,"A career as a doctor is on hold.
"
p254_217,"You have to do your research.
"
p254_218,"Saturday is gone.
"
p254_219,"We played them off the pitch.
"
p254_220,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p254_221,"Clearly, the stakes are high.
"
p254_222,"The boy is no longer with us.
"
p254_223,"The track is currently covered in snow.
"
p254_224,"They are the innocent victims.
"
p254_225,"It's so special.
"
p254_226,"Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
"
p254_227,"At the time, he was a living legend.
"
p254_228,"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
"
p254_229,"Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
"
p254_230,"They tried to give her advice.
"
p254_231,"And thought we would get away with it.
"
p254_232,"We were a load of rubbish.
"
p254_233,"They should come forward.
"
p254_234,"It is not the message alone.
"
p254_235,"He will make a statement on the dispute in the Commons tomorrow.
"
p254_236,"The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
"
p254_237,"It's a lovely, lovely film.
"
p254_238,"But it's a subtle process.
"
p254_239,"The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
"
p254_240,"My future is in the marathon.
"
p254_241,"They are all bright and different.
"
p254_242,"Chambers said he would accept the place.
"
p254_243,"I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
"
p254_244,"In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
"
p254_245,"The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
"
p254_246,"He got the same story.
"
p254_247,"Washington is consumed by the crisis.
"
p254_248,"I was shocked.
"
p254_249,"He's a lovely young man.
"
p254_250,"There's the mix.
"
p254_251,"There will be widespread support on all sides.
"
p254_252,"This year I understood.
"
p254_253,"That could be in place by next year.
"
p254_254,"I was never going to play against Scotland.
"
p254_255,"It's a source of deep concern.
"
p254_256,"For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
"
p254_257,"However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
"
p254_258,"The pensioners did not want to know.
"
p254_259,"It is also very valuable.
"
p254_260,"This court has made an order which has not been observed.
"
p254_261,"The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
"
p254_262,"He thought he had a month to cross the street.
"
p254_263,"That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
"
p254_264,"They want to shut the Scottish Office.
"
p254_265,"There is no link.
"
p254_266,"This is a question of Islam.
"
p254_267,"The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
"
p254_268,"He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
"
p254_269,"Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
"
p254_270,"It was an easy decision to come here.
"
p254_271,"We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
"
p254_272,"It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
"
p254_273,"Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
"
p254_275,"Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
"
p254_276,"Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
"
p254_277,"It's a way of life.
"
p254_278,"She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
"
p254_279,"However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
"
p254_280,"People have no choice.
"
p254_281,"If not, he should go home.
"
p254_282,"For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
"
p254_283,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p254_284,"You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
"
p254_285,"I saw it at a ruck.
"
p254_286,"This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
"
p254_287,"What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
"
p254_288,"He will address the nation this evening.
"
p254_289,"The mood is good.
"
p254_290,"It's like a high school play.
"
p254_291,"The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
"
p254_292,"This is a national crisis.
"
p254_293,"Well, he can do it.
"
p254_294,"These figures are truly awful.
"
p254_295,"That could change.
"
p254_296,"Who can predict?
"
p254_297,"In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
"
p254_298,"One was a lawyer.
"
p254_299,"It is a road of death.
"
p254_300,"The plot is minimal.
"
p254_301,"The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
"
p254_302,"I did not name it.
"
p254_303,"We have waited a long time for this.
"
p254_304,"Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
"
p254_305,"They were fantastic.
"
p254_306,"We are a peaceful people.
"
p254_307,"Craig is a major concern for us.
"
p254_308,"The problems began a long time ago.
"
p254_309,"My body is clearly capable.
"
p254_310,"It is out there.
"
p254_311,"He said she was mad.
"
p254_312,"In the old days, it was easy.
"
p254_313,"We are in the end game.
"
p254_314,"They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
"
p254_315,"It is a strong case.
"
p254_316,"The parents will have a great time, too.
"
p254_317,"Donald was his friend.
"
p254_318,"He was not a big name.
"
p254_319,"The police have to act to help them.
"
p254_320,"It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
"
p254_321,"The boat was fantastic.
"
p254_322,"It's not long enough.
"
p254_323,"My first concern is for the safety of the public.
"
p254_324,"Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
"
p254_326,"Finally, he paid for the movie.
"
p254_327,"You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
"
p254_329,"It would appear that it has not been a problem.
"
p254_330,"They haven't got a hope.
"
p254_331,"It has moved on in the last week.
"
p254_332,"I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
"
p254_333,"Today she has been released.
"
p254_334,"The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
"
p254_335,"It should be a great game, though.
"
p254_336,"It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
"
p254_337,"It should be scrapped.
"
p254_338,"A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
"
p254_339,"It was good for us that they lost that day.
"
p254_340,"They should take their mobile phones.
"
p254_341,"It is not like working for a living.
"
p254_342,"Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
"
p254_343,"It is long gone.
"
p254_344,"The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
"
p254_345,"Tell us about it.
"
p254_346,"It's all going to clear the debt.
"
p254_347,"That is a break with tradition.
"
p254_348,"A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
"
p254_349,"It was very formal.
"
p254_350,"I kept going for her.
"
p254_351,"The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
"
p254_352,"But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
"
p254_353,"No other job in world football can compare to this one.
"
