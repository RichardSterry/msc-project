p246_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p246_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p246_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p246_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p246_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p246_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p246_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p246_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p246_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p246_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p246_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p246_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p246_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p246_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p246_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p246_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p246_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p246_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p246_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p246_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p246_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p246_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p246_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p246_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p246_025,"He has not been named.
"
p246_026,"We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
"
p246_027,"Is this accurate?
"
p246_028,"However, the following year the cancer returned.
"
p246_029,"They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
"
p246_030,"There's a story, too.
"
p246_031,"This is the window.
"
p246_032,"He was jailed for five years.
"
p246_033,"We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
"
p246_034,"Then, suddenly, they weren't.
"
p246_035,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p246_036,"It has failed.
"
p246_037,"They're just different.
"
p246_038,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p246_039,"Indeed, he does.
"
p246_040,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p246_041,"The ambition this year is to improve on last.
"
p246_042,"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
"
p246_043,"It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
"
p246_044,"We will push.
"
p246_045,"Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
"
p246_046,"They said she was stable.
"
p246_047,"Is a drug dealer?
"
p246_048,"There is no reason at all.
"
p246_049,"The State would provide.
"
p246_050,"She looked so young.
"
p246_051,"Every aspect of our play was first class.
"
p246_052,"Here's a clue.
"
p246_053,"Her body was found about four miles from the car.
"
p246_054,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p246_055,"It is unique.
"
p246_056,"This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
"
p246_057,"That's the truth.
"
p246_058,"I feel I did not have enough time.
"
p246_059,"The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
"
p246_060,"Scotland had great assets.
"
p246_061,"It's that kind of place.
"
p246_062,"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
"
p246_063,"He could make it.
"
p246_064,"Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
"
p246_065,"Robin Williams is very subdued.
"
p246_066,"The tournament has now been cancelled.
"
p246_067,"There could be a way back.
"
p246_068,"Then followed a bout of flu.
"
p246_069,"Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
"
p246_070,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p246_071,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p246_072,"Even the one she loved.
"
p246_073,"People must remain vigilant.
"
p246_074,"Today she has been released.
"
p246_075,"The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
"
p246_076,"It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
"
p246_077,"He is in the queue.
"
p246_078,"I first met him last summer.
"
p246_079,"He seems to be pleased with the picture.
"
p246_080,"A play is a set of actions.
"
p246_081,"Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
"
p246_082,"It is a blow.
"
p246_083,"Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
"
p246_084,"They lived for their children.
"
p246_085,"It will be tight.
"
p246_086,"The city council is a major property owner in the area.
"
p246_087,"Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
"
p246_088,"Tony Blair said as little.
"
p246_089,"As, indeed, they would be.
"
p246_090,"This one did.
"
p246_091,"It was clear.
"
p246_092,"But I was wrong.
"
p246_093,"It is home-grown.
"
p246_094,"I saw the whole thing.
"
p246_095,"Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
"
p246_096,"However, we have not come to any conclusions.
"
p246_097,"They make a selective perception process.
"
p246_098,"Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
"
p246_099,"No, the equipment is extra.
"
p246_100,"That would be unlawful.
"
p246_101,"Oil embargo endorsed.
"
p246_102,"But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
"
p246_103,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p246_104,"It was an adventure.
"
p246_105,"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
"
p246_106,"I was fighting for my life, I thought.
"
p246_107,"Is that right?
"
p246_108,"I had some time with Aston Villa.
"
p246_109,"It was the eighties.
"
p246_110,"It is so sad.
"
p246_111,"It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
"
p246_112,"They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
"
p246_113,"Who would be a referee?
"
p246_114,"That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
"
p246_115,"There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
"
p246_116,"Who would have?
"
p246_117,"Here, again, they were denied a voice.
"
p246_118,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p246_119,"It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
"
p246_120,"She really suffered for her art.
"
p246_121,"It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
"
p246_122,"It is not a U-turn.
"
p246_123,"I just wanted a break.
"
p246_124,"Twaddle is a case in point.
"
p246_125,"I am now unemployed.
"
p246_126,"She said she would not welcome the flowers.
"
p246_127,"It plans to return to this field.
"
p246_128,"It's perfectly feasible.
"
p246_129,"We work well together.
"
p246_130,"Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
"
p246_131,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p246_132,"We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
"
p246_133,"My daughter is an adult.
"
p246_134,"He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
"
p246_135,"It seems so long since I did the exams.
"
p246_136,"Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
"
p246_137,"We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
"
p246_138,"No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
"
p246_139,"She died at her home.
"
p246_140,"He realises his mistake.
"
p246_141,"He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
"
p246_142,"I was awful.
"
p246_143,"They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
"
p246_144,"Washington is consumed by the crisis.
"
p246_145,"He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
"
p246_146,"It is not just about pay.
"
p246_147,"I am just trying to do my job.
"
p246_148,"He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
"
p246_149,"It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
"
p246_150,"I was stunned.
"
p246_151,"But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
"
p246_152,"The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
"
p246_153,"The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
"
p246_154,"She had gone to the Catholic school.
"
p246_155,"We are on a four-year mission.
"
p246_156,"She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
"
p246_157,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p246_158,"I'd love to be like Peter.
"
p246_159,"I will tell you.
"
p246_160,"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
"
p246_161,"It is not like us.
"
p246_162,"It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
"
p246_163,"We have a budget in March.
"
p246_164,"Again, we were lucky.
"
p246_165,"We should do everything at a stroke.
"
p246_166,"You had to go and see him.
"
p246_167,"It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
"
p246_168,"He was a crazy man.
"
p246_169,"As we worked.
"
p246_170,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p246_171,"It is not either national standards or local control.
"
p246_172,"If that's the case, he will struggle.
"
p246_173,"I drove the ball well.
"
p246_174,"Tony had arrived.
"
p246_175,"The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
"
p246_176,"I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
"
p246_177,"The goals were good.
"
p246_178,"And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
"
p246_179,"Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
"
p246_180,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p246_181,"It's to do with context.
"
p246_182,"Does this matter?
"
p246_183,"One was a lawyer.
"
p246_184,"There is no openness.
"
p246_185,"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
"
p246_186,"I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
"
p246_187,"It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
"
p246_188,"It was very frightened and dirty.
"
p246_189,"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
"
p246_190,"The concerns are the same.
"
p246_191,"Is that success?
"
p246_192,"I do not own the vessel in question.
"
p246_193,"On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
"
p246_194,"I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
"
p246_195,"Who will pay for this?
"
p246_196,"They've got three-quarters of the way.
"
p246_197,"The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
"
p246_198,"It's all about money, money, money.
"
p246_199,"Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
"
p246_200,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p246_201,"I will win.
"
p246_202,"Feel the heat?
"
p246_203,"He knows a lot.
"
p246_204,"We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
"
p246_205,"It had all been arranged.
"
p246_206,"I have decided to quit the show.
"
p246_207,"My neighbours are horrified.
"
p246_208,"It's not ideal.
"
p246_209,"In each case they were a goal down.
"
p246_210,"I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
"
p246_211,"However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
"
p246_212,"For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
"
p246_213,"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
"
p246_214,"The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
"
p246_215,"The report is due out next month.
"
p246_216,"Because they didn't want to know.
"
p246_217,"At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
"
p246_218,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p246_219,"Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
"
p246_220,"It's a question of creating a future awareness.
"
p246_221,"I'd never seen a play about me.
"
p246_222,"It's not before time.
"
p246_223,"I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
"
p246_224,"He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
"
p246_225,"But she was.
"
p246_226,"Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
"
p246_227,"At the time, he was a living legend.
"
p246_228,"My wife and family are the support system.
"
p246_229,"Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
"
p246_230,"The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
"
p246_231,"But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
"
p246_232,"Of course I was tempted.
"
p246_233,"Well, they were the unlucky ones.
"
p246_234,"You should be.
"
p246_235,"It's quite nice.
"
p246_236,"The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
"
p246_237,"Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
"
p246_238,"In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
"
p246_239,"A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
"
p246_240,"It is hard won.
"
p246_241,"We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
"
p246_242,"I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
"
p246_243,"The scene is about this?
"
p246_244,"We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
"
p246_245,"In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
"
p246_246,"I should think so, too.
"
p246_247,"It was a hit.
"
p246_248,"There's the mix.
"
p246_249,"After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
"
p246_250,"Is there on his hands?
"
p246_251,"I can't get a job.
"
p246_252,"That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
"
p246_253,"they fail to engage.
"
p246_254,"One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
"
p246_255,"Is that a serious question?
"
p246_256,"They must play for each other.
"
p246_257,"I could have got out a long time ago.
"
p246_258,"He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
"
p246_259,"However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
"
p246_260,"There's not much money in cycling.
"
p246_261,"Souter will be back.
"
p246_262,"Blood samples were taken.
"
p246_263,"They want to shut the Scottish Office.
"
p246_264,"It will be done in stages.
"
p246_265,"There is no link.
"
p246_266,"That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
"
p246_267,"Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
"
p246_268,"We are happy.
"
p246_270,"We're in shock.
"
p246_271,"Our objective is to tackle poverty.
"
p246_272,"Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
"
p246_273,"It's a way of life.
"
p246_274,"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
"
p246_275,"She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
"
p246_276,"He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
"
p246_277,"They seem to get away with it.
"
p246_278,"In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
"
p246_279,"It is so very obvious.
"
p246_280,"In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
"
p246_281,"It's so awful.
"
p246_282,"If not, he should go home.
"
p246_283,"It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
"
p246_284,"We are a grandmother.
"
p246_285,"But I've won both ways.
"
p246_286,"Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
"
p246_287,"You feel very helpless.
"
p246_288,"This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
"
p246_289,"Dialogue is the key.
"
p246_290,"He will address the nation this evening.
"
p246_291,"It was a virus.
"
p246_292,"Yet, it worked.
"
p246_293,"The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
"
p246_294,"It was good.
"
p246_295,"Bombing slaughter rejected
"
p246_296,"We are not going to forget.
"
p246_297,"No Briton has ever won.
"
p246_298,"And huge, indeed, it is.
"
p246_299,"Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
"
p246_300,"He was at home with his pals.
"
p246_301,"What has altered?
"
p246_302,"She is really magic.
"
p246_303,"The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
"
p246_304,"A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
"
p246_305,"Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
"
p246_306,"We could easily be cut again.
"
p246_307,"The plot is minimal.
"
p246_308,"You are the glory.
"
p246_309,"The minister is the engineer.
"
p246_310,"The letters are going out today.
"
p246_311,"I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
"
p246_312,"and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
"
p246_313,"We have got no money to go anywhere.
"
p246_314,"She is on a life support machine.
"
p246_315,"We are a peaceful people.
"
p246_316,"The election is total confusion and chaos.
"
p246_318,"Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
"
p246_319,"They had a confession.
"
p246_320,"I came into this world with nothing.
"
p246_321,"It's too horrible to think.
"
p246_322,"Off with their heads.
"
p246_323,"There was no time scale.
"
p246_324,"Either team will be hard.
"
p246_325,"It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
"
p246_326,"He scored a touchdown.
"
p246_327,"Is that an issue?
"
p246_328,"You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
"
p246_329,"Who will do it?
"
p246_330,"I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
"
p246_331,"Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
"
p246_332,"This is the last straw.
"
p246_333,"Two people were interviewed.
"
p246_334,"I've got no secret.
"
p246_335,"He loved the moment.
"
p246_336,"I'm very lucky.
"
p246_337,"Our policy is clear.
"
p246_338,"In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
"
p246_339,"Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
"
p246_340,"A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
"
p246_341,"This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
"
p246_342,"They should take their mobile phones.
"
p246_343,"I got a yellow card.
"
p246_344,"The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
"
p246_345,"He had taken everything from me.
"
p246_346,"He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
"
p246_347,"Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
"
p246_348,"Until they came to do it.
"
p246_349,"You must have a government and a good civil service.
