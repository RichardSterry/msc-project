p237_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p237_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p237_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p237_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p237_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p237_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p237_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p237_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p237_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p237_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p237_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p237_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p237_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p237_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p237_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p237_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p237_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p237_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p237_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p237_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p237_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p237_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p237_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p237_025,"He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
"
p237_026,"They should be so lucky.
"
p237_027,"I have a theory.
"
p237_028,"They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
"
p237_029,"The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
"
p237_030,"However, the following year the cancer returned.
"
p237_031,"We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
"
p237_032,"There's a story, too.
"
p237_033,"This is the window.
"
p237_034,"I think a move would create a lot of interest.
"
p237_035,"I'd like to continue that record.
"
p237_036,"They're just different.
"
p237_037,"It was clear.
"
p237_038,"It is not for any other purpose.
"
p237_039,"The problem is the pitch.
"
p237_040,"It's a great thing.
"
p237_041,"He did not know his daughter.
"
p237_042,"This film will be totally awesome.
"
p237_043,"That is a break with tradition.
"
p237_044,"It's the only thing.
"
p237_045,"It is so sad.
"
p237_046,"There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
"
p237_047,"It is urgent.
"
p237_048,"I feel pretty good.
"
p237_049,"We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
"
p237_050,"It is bizarre.
"
p237_051,"That should do it.
"
p237_052,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p237_053,"She looked so young.
"
p237_054,"It has been a horrible, horrible time.
"
p237_055,"Life is good.
"
p237_056,"No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
"
p237_057,"I was inspired by two things.
"
p237_058,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p237_059,"We were surprised to see the photograph.
"
p237_060,"New York is expected to come to a standstill.
"
p237_061,"I've had six days of rehearsal.
"
p237_062,"None has ever been found.
"
p237_063,"It's a real challenge.
"
p237_064,"You do not change overnight.
"
p237_065,"Art is extra.
"
p237_066,"The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
"
p237_067,"Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
"
p237_068,"Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
"
p237_069,"It is like a river running by my home.
"
p237_070,"We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
"
p237_071,"Try to save us.
"
p237_072,"The end result is precisely the same.
"
p237_073,"There is an element of racism in Scotland.
"
p237_074,"Painful, but only because it's true.
"
p237_075,"I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
"
p237_076,"The price cuts are really exciting.
"
p237_077,"IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
"
p237_078,"It is a terrible place.
"
p237_079,"Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
"
p237_080,"It may well have been.
"
p237_081,"It's all going to clear the debt.
"
p237_082,"I first met him last summer.
"
p237_083,"He is driven.
"
p237_084,"Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
"
p237_085,"Someone who cares
"
p237_086,"It's never too late.
"
p237_087,"Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
"
p237_088,"Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
"
p237_089,"Now the system is right behind us.
"
p237_090,"Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
"
p237_091,"Today I couldn't run on it.
"
p237_092,"However, it did not end that way.
"
p237_093,"We must look forward.
"
p237_094,"I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
"
p237_095,"Until you hit the big games.
"
p237_096,"We could not get any possession.
"
p237_097,"I love the Dome.
"
p237_098,"I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
"
p237_099,"By that time, however, it was already too late.
"
p237_100,"They were outside the circle.
"
p237_101,"A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
"
p237_102,"But it was a pleasure.
"
p237_103,"It was some time before she found out he was safe.
"
p237_104,"We want to get to the final, anyway.
"
p237_105,"I didn't play well last year.
"
p237_106,"Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
"
p237_107,"They had to be cut from the wreckage.
"
p237_108,"I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
"
p237_109,"It is normal.
"
p237_110,"Further protests are likely.
"
p237_111,"It's in his blood.
"
p237_112,"Who would be right ?
"
p237_113,"It's a shame.
"
p237_114,"I came to complete.
"
p237_117,"This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
"
p237_118,"On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
"
p237_119,"Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
"
p237_120,"Does this mean.
"
p237_121,"They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
"
p237_122,"It is a delight on every level.
"
p237_123,"An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
"
p237_124,"I felt very strongly that England should have it.
"
p237_125,"But it took a lot of bottle.
"
p237_126,"I thought it was a fantastic game.
"
p237_127,"I'm so angry.
"
p237_128,"Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
"
p237_129,"She really suffered for her art.
"
p237_130,"It's terrible that he has died the same way.
"
p237_131,"Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
"
p237_132,"Offered the gold medal, he declined.
"
p237_133,"Who will attend ?
"
p237_134,"The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
"
p237_135,"It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
"
p237_136,"They made such decisions in London.
"
p237_137,"It's perfectly feasible.
"
p237_138,"They took a risk.
"
p237_139,"The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
"
p237_140,"The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
"
p237_141,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p237_142,"He has the edge.
"
p237_143,"Three penalties were given.
"
p237_144,"It seems so long since I did the exams.
"
p237_145,"In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
"
p237_146,"She hopes to study in Britain one day.
"
p237_147,"We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
"
p237_148,"He is severe.
"
p237_149,"She died at her home.
"
p237_150,"Is that Titanic ?
"
p237_151,"The idea is simple.
"
p237_153,"He will emerge as a world leader.
"
p237_154,"It opens the door to the Champions League.
"
p237_155,"It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
"
p237_156,"It is huge.
"
p237_157,"The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
"
p237_159,"It is not normal practice.
"
p237_160,"Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
"
p237_161,"We also enjoyed a lot of support.
"
p237_162,"It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
"
p237_163,"We are now up against it.
"
p237_164,"I was in daily contact.
"
p237_165,"He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
"
p237_166,"The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
"
p237_167,"Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
"
p237_168,"They should stop the bombing.
"
p237_169,"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
"
p237_170,"It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
"
p237_171,"I was in the train station overnight.
"
p237_172,"We knew we had the goal we wanted.
"
p237_173,"He is keen to stay in public service.
"
p237_174,"I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
"
p237_175,"Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
"
p237_176,"Does that put pressure on us ?
"
p237_177,"The release attracted little attention.
"
p237_178,"Waiting times for these services are too long.
"
p237_179,"He was a crazy man.
"
p237_180,"A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
"
p237_181,"Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
"
p237_182,"One season, they might do well.
"
p237_183,"First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
"
p237_184,"This is a sad day.
"
p237_185,"The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
"
p237_186,"The hotel was now for sale.
"
p237_187,"I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
"
p237_188,"Government will intervene.
"
p237_189,"Four policemen were wounded.
"
p237_190,"They receive a high profile in the media.
"
p237_191,"It's a joke.
"
p237_192,"Miller was every bit as happy.
"
p237_193,"I wish I could say something.
"
p237_194,"It is tough, but possible.
"
p237_195,"I've got good news and bad news for you.
"
p237_196,"We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
"
p237_198,"If the director is with you.
"
p237_199,"The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
"
p237_200,"It is a case of taking a risk.
"
p237_201,"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
"
p237_202,"Our strategy is straightforward.
"
p237_203,"Is that success ?
"
p237_204,"Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
"
p237_205,"Tommy is not a problem.
"
p237_206,"The sisters also became the two top players in the world.
"
p237_207,"He was also married with two children.
"
p237_208,"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
"
p237_210,"It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
"
p237_211,"After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
"
p237_212,"I don't want to use it.
"
p237_213,"Now, it's all right.
"
p237_214,"There was an e-mail.
"
p237_215,"Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
"
p237_216,"It is a gamble.
"
p237_217,"He is slightly confused.
"
p237_218,"She should not be blamed.
"
p237_219,"I began to pray.
"
p237_220,"I had decided to quit the show.
"
p237_221,"I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
"
p237_222,"By hard work, is the answer.
"
p237_223,"The FBI could become involved.
"
p237_224,"However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
"
p237_225,"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
"
p237_226,"He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
"
p237_227,"You have to do your research.
"
p237_228,"William Hague delighted his party.
"
p237_229,"Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
"
p237_230,"Clearly, the stakes are high.
"
p237_231,"It's a question of creating a future awareness.
"
p237_232,"I am immensely sad.
"
p237_233,"I'd never seen a play about me.
"
p237_234,"It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
"
p237_235,"I can't wait to meet him.
"
p237_236,"Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
"
p237_237,"They are the innocent victims.
"
p237_238,"Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
"
p237_239,"The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
"
p237_240,"You take a risk.
"
p237_241,"They tried to give her advice.
"
p237_242,"Police later said the scheme would end in November.
"
p237_243,"It's a dead end.
"
p237_244,"We are in the hat.
"
p237_245,"Of course, that is not the whole story.
"
p237_246,"They should come forward.
"
p237_247,"It is not the message alone.
"
p237_248,"Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
"
p237_249,"He says that he is no different from any other man.
"
p237_250,"It's quite a line-up !
"
p237_251,"It's a lovely, lovely film.
"
p237_252,"It would still have been a good film, but very different.
"
p237_253,"We were extremely poor.
"
p237_254,"I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
"
p237_255,"We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
"
p237_256,"It would appear that it has not been a problem.
"
p237_257,"Chambers said he would accept the place.
"
p237_258,"Both reports appear in the British Medical Journal.
"
p237_259,"You can feel at home in China.
"
p237_260,"Our decision making was poor.
"
p237_262,"The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
"
p237_263,"They are different types.
"
p237_264,"There's the mix.
"
p237_265,"There will be widespread support on all sides.
"
p237_266,"Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
"
p237_267,"Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
"
p237_268,"That could be in place by next year.
"
p237_270,"Special measures were needed.
"
p237_271,"It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
"
p237_272,"This is a big club.
"
p237_273,"Blair is very positive at European Councils.
"
p237_274,"One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
"
p237_275,"I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
"
p237_276,"It is also very valuable.
"
p237_277,"The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
"
p237_278,"The warning is timely.
"
p237_279,"It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
"
p237_280,"That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
"
p237_281,"There is no link.
"
p237_282,"This is a question of Islam.
"
p237_283,"That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
"
p237_284,"Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
"
p237_285,"Immediate action must be taken.
"
p237_286,"Frankly, we should all have such problems.
"
p237_287,"We're in shock.
"
p237_288,"You know the type.
"
p237_289,"She failed in her action.
"
p237_290,"He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
"
p237_291,"However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
"
p237_292,"They seem to get away with it.
"
p237_293,"People have no choice.
"
p237_294,"He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
"
p237_295,"I saw it at a ruck.
"
p237_296,"I intended to look for another club on loan.
"
p237_297,"Mr Campbell received a phone call.
"
p237_298,"Holland won by five wickets.
"
p237_299,"She said she could not believe that they had run away.
"
p237_300,"It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
"
p237_301,"That could change.
"
p237_302,"He should have won.
"
p237_303,"Who can predict ?
"
p237_304,"The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
"
p237_305,"We have to sort it out ourselves.
"
p237_306,"I was the sheep.
"
p237_307,"Graeme was prepared.
"
p237_308,"However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
"
p237_309,"It is a road of death.
"
p237_310,"This is a war over our home.
"
p237_311,"In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
"
p237_312,"The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
"
p237_313,"They were on holiday in Egypt.
"
p237_314,"I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
"
p237_315,"SCOTLAND has shown the way.
"
p237_316,"It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
"
p237_317,"It is no surprise.
"
p237_318,"We want to play at the worlds.
"
p237_320,"They were fantastic.
"
p237_321,"I never thought it would take this long.
"
p237_322,"They wanted the club to make money.
"
p237_323,"It should be equal.
"
p237_325,"We are very strongly behind the bid.
"
p237_326,"In the old days, it was easy.
"
p237_327,"The parents will have a great time, too.
"
p237_328,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p237_329,"I am so upset.
"
p237_330,"Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
"
p237_331,"Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
"
p237_332,"It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
"
p237_333,"He was then replaced by Ross.
"
p237_334,"I saw some good things.
"
p237_335,"He can do no wrong.
"
p237_337,"Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
"
p237_338,"There was a bit of urgency in the second half.
"
p237_339,"They haven't got a hope.
"
p237_340,"It has moved on in the last week.
"
p237_341,"I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
"
p237_342,"That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
"
p237_343,"He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
"
p237_344,"The train was on time.
"
p237_345,"They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
"
p237_346,"The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
"
p237_347,"Indeed, it was magical.
"
p237_348,"Look at the witnesses.
"
p237_349,"Nobody else was with me.
"
p237_350,"The composer will conduct.
"
p237_351,"It should be scrapped.
"
