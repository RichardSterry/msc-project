p336_001,Please call Stella.
p336_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p336_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p336_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p336_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p336_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p336_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p336_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p336_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p336_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p336_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p336_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p336_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p336_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p336_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p336_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p336_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p336_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p336_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p336_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p336_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p336_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p336_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed forms yellow."
p336_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p336_025,I am very happy with the result.
p336_026,She took them for a term.
p336_027,It is deeply worrying.
p336_028,This is a very interesting move.
p336_029,Are we not men?
p336_030,How could it not?
p336_031,It is sending the wrong message to people.
p336_032,"Another former manager, Bobby Robson said."
p336_033,We are proud of them.
p336_034,We had a really good experience with David.
p336_035,It was another good idea.
p336_036,I want to make a vigorous defence.
p336_037,That incident altered the pattern of the game.
p336_038,IT is a terrible equation.
p336_039,That gives us something to kick against.
p336_040,It was pretty special.
p336_041,"Whatever we are doing, they have good reason to come."
p336_042,I should say so.
p336_043,Yet therein is the problem.
p336_044,This isn't a new problem.
p336_045,"That, though, was just the start of it."
p336_046,My office is down there.
p336_047,There can be no dispute about our history.
p336_048,The crowd was waiting.
p336_049,It was a joy.
p336_050,It's the same with cinema.
p336_051,It was the climax of the thing.
p336_052,He died from multiple injuries.
p336_053,It is nearly there.
p336_054,I'm going to buy a car.
p336_055,"We said, What do you mean?"
p336_056,I have been there many times.
p336_057,The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p336_058,This ruling is a farce.
p336_059,They enjoy playing the game.
p336_060,It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p336_061,It is not standing army.
p336_062,It was a crucial moment.
p336_063,Someone else has now got them.
p336_064,The second is freedom.
p336_065,I let go the telephone and ran.
p336_066,Get used to it.
p336_067,"For one thing, he was growing far too quickly."
p336_068,Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
p336_069,"After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show."
p336_070,"Sadly, in this case, that was not so."
p336_071,The hearing was continued until a later date.
p336_072,"Still, some additions are inspired."
p336_073,Any error is severely punished.
p336_074,Yet what is supposed to be said?
p336_075,But we will learn from that.
p336_076,He has not created a Festival resource.
p336_077,We couldn't afford it.
p336_078,I get the bus.
p336_079,"I might have been sitting at home, with her out here."
p336_080,"Frankly, we should all have such problems."
p336_081,The issues are not going to change.
p336_082,"Four minutes later, the show was over."
p336_083,Would you have ever believed that was possible?
p336_084,It will be easier for us.
p336_085,I don't think it is.
p336_086,There are no other contenders.
p336_087,On that they agree.
p336_088,They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p336_089,But who was driving it?
p336_090,We have to get this sorted out.
p336_091,It was very fast.
p336_092,Singing is my first love.
p336_093,When is it ever anything else?
p336_094,It's hard to see it.
p336_095,I believe in trade unions.
p336_096,"Sub Not Used, Mackay."
p336_097,This is in a league of its own.
p336_098,The partnership was set up during the summer.
p336_099,That statement has never been withdrawn.
p336_100,The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p336_101,That is unlikely to happen.
p336_102,That is a mark of what you are.
p336_103,This is not finished.
p336_104,It was one of the firemen.
p336_105,"Now, she has completed a family tradition."
p336_106,Don't you believe it.
p336_107,There is another important factor.
p336_108,Most people know that.
p336_109,I want to keep playing.
p336_110,"At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news."
p336_111,"The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels."
p336_112,That is how we will be judged.
p336_113,It's there for people to look at.
p336_114,We are getting there.
p336_115,I just couldn't believe what had happened.
p336_116,They never got into the show this time.
p336_117,"He, too, is keen to redress the balance."
p336_118,"But no, it's not funny."
p336_119,We just try to make great records.
p336_120,It's almost certainly not going to help.
p336_121,Why does it come out now?
p336_122,"In that case, the children were not missing."
p336_123,These figures are truly awful.
p336_124,The whole thing was just unreal.
p336_125,They haven't been thought through.
p336_126,They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
p336_127,"It's better than that, it's fantastic."
p336_128,The criteria have changed.
p336_129,Everyone in front of me was dead.
p336_130,Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p336_131,I have thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p336_132,I just have no maternal instincts.
p336_133,It has been declared.
p336_134,"His commitment, on the other hand, is clear."
p336_135,"Clearly, audiences are unsettled."
p336_136,It's very hard to plan for it.
p336_137,There is nothing like this back home.
p336_138,They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
p336_139,He is that good.
p336_140,We did not have a clue.
p336_141,We need to be more specific.
p336_142,This is the man who provides the hope.
p336_143,This is a war over our home.
p336_144,He's got me very well.
p336_145,He has been banned from the Salmon Inn.
p336_146,He was always nice to me.
p336_147,He looked at me before replying.
p336_148,Then there is the Mini itself.
p336_149,This may be perfectly innocent.
p336_150,It's good for the city.
p336_151,The only answer is a public inquiry.
p336_152,Controllers major concern is safety.
p336_153,It's like an extension of your body.
p336_154,Because he usually is.
p336_155,"It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete."
p336_156,We have waited a long time for this.
p336_157,I want my audience to be challenged.
p336_158,This is the culture change in medicine.
p336_159,Who do you think you are?
p336_160,Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
p336_161,I have no battle with the Scots.
p336_162,I hope he gets it.
p336_163,Everything has its place and purpose.
p336_164,"Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile."
p336_165,I am here to work for Scottish Labour.
p336_166,Nobody could survive on that.
p336_167,I can't do anything before nine.
p336_168,Their vision was not impeded.
p336_169,He is married with three children.
p336_170,These days will be back.
p336_171,"However, they should not come as a surprise."
p336_172,It could last five months.
p336_173,Everything is accounted for.
p336_174,The support from the general public was astounding.
p336_175,"About time too, you might think."
p336_176,"However, it does not tell the full story."
p336_177,We have made mistakes and were badly punished.
p336_178,The bombing has had a huge influence.
p336_179,We've got a mixture of both.
p336_180,I'm very happy to be here.
p336_181,This is not the case.
p336_182,This one was supposed to be so different.
p336_183,I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p336_184,"It has been difficult for her to do, he says."
p336_185,They are now out in the cold.
p336_186,"However, planners should be taking the lead."
p336_187,Cloning is not ready.
p336_188,New Labour are running scared.
p336_189,It is a good result for Great Britain.
p336_190,The weekly average was three hours.
p336_191,Is there a new way forward?
p336_192,Don't hold your breath!
p336_193,This is the start of a slippery slope.
p336_194,Where do you think she is going?
p336_195,Safety is our first concern.
p336_196,"In fact, it was almost as if it was expected."
p336_197,Inspections are not the problem.
p336_198,But who will buy it?
p336_199,And it's more subversive.
p336_200,Openness is always the best way.
p336_201,It wouldn't go off.
p336_202,"I've been enjoying it, though."
p336_203,The professor said the results were positive.
p336_204,I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
p336_205,It's part of the end game.
p336_206,Do they play for the money?
p336_207,The train was on time.
p336_208,"So, where do we go from here?"
p336_209,The claim was denied by the first minister.
p336_210,"More than that, it's a vicious circle."
p336_211,And how much of a compliment is that?
p336_213,Politics is a tough game.
p336_214,I have friends in Glasgow.
p336_215,What has changed?
p336_216,There's nothing to be gained by it.
p336_217,Chambers said he would accept the place.
p336_218,We have been through this with the lawyers.
p336_219,I'm not interested in the job.
p336_220,His contract was then not renewed.
p336_221,"Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance."
p336_222,The warnings were a good reminder.
p336_223,I came here this week to work.
p336_224,It's the last thing on my mind.
p336_225,Barry Ferguson is one of them.
p336_226,The biggest resource is our staff.
p336_227,We have big ideas.
p336_228,How will we get there?
p336_229,She told me to stop.
p336_230,I wish him well for the future.
p336_231,Cars are great for going long distances.
p336_232,"It's not a party, no, no."
p336_233,The lads are having a tour.
p336_234,It may not be life long.
p336_235,Everyone was in tears.
p336_236,It was just above the roof.
p336_237,These were the dreams.
p336_238,But we must work in harmony.
p336_239,It's a bit like a bereavement.
p336_240,There is no other way.
p336_241,Everyone must be focused on the league.
p336_242,The English are coming.
p336_243,You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p336_244,I believe in theatre.
p336_245,Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
p336_246,It's time to say enough is enough.
p336_247,He has to pull back from the brink.
p336_248,She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
p336_249,I don't have any regrets about the edit.
p336_250,That does not mean we have failed.
p336_251,The family baton is handed on.
p336_252,She has a little boy.
p336_253,Our policy is very clear on this issue.
p336_254,He has refused to do that.
p336_255,I can understand why they have gone.
p336_256,All my training is for Athens.
p336_257,This is a personal decision for me.
p336_258,When will you listen?
p336_259,I'm happy that we have agreed.
p336_260,All of them were killed.
p336_261,All the children on the roll are genuine.
p336_262,"Sub Not Used, McCormick."
p336_263,You can spend money on housing.
p336_264,Ferguson must take the blame.
p336_265,There is no point in denying that.
p336_266,The kids are paying the price.
p336_267,Not that it is unique.
p336_268,We're all going to take a holiday.
p336_269,I've got three other ideas for the day.
p336_270,Some injustice was committed.
p336_271,I've had a wonderful career.
p336_272,The BBC was a disgrace.
p336_273,I didn't expect to be in.
p336_274,The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p336_275,I reckon he won't make the mistake again.
p336_276,"I should think so, too."
p336_277,"If so, we want to hear from them."
p336_278,It's not covered by the insurance.
p336_279,He denied the charge.
p336_280,I was shaking on the blocks.
p336_281,There is no easy answer.
p336_282,I watch the other visitors.
p336_283,Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
p336_284,I am not a liar.
p336_285,The cause remained a mystery last night.
p336_286,He had no problem with alcohol.
p336_287,I had no experience at all.
p336_288,Yet he remains confident enough.
p336_289,It has become very confused.
p336_290,Fame and money followed.
p336_291,It's a national sport.
p336_292,I just made it.
p336_293,There was no secrecy.
p336_294,A wide range of restrictions are in place.
p336_295,Even then it might be difficult.
p336_296,I can't believe we didn't win that game.
p336_297,"Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging."
p336_299,Relief was beyond belief.
p336_300,Beyond that would have been outrageous.
p336_301,It was complete nonsense.
p336_302,I seem to keep this for the majors.
p336_303,It is three years.
p336_304,They are not always the same person.
p336_305,We meet again in Berlin.
p336_306,This is a very special moment for me.
p336_307,It is a daunting task.
p336_308,"Well, it did last time, he was reminded."
p336_309,We have chosen for the patients.
p336_310,That was me today.
p336_311,That is when we are really effective.
p336_312,They just would not have run away.
p336_313,But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
p336_314,This idea has been around for four years.
p336_315,But he made a mistake in picking it.
p336_316,This is an appealing record.
p336_317,They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
p336_318,Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
p336_319,This is a problem we have to tackle.
p336_320,"Yes, it was uplifting."
p336_321,Nobody should believe this story.
p336_322,No person has been charged.
p336_323,One paper was not returned.
p336_324,I don't want to do too much.
p336_325,We don't have money to get to town.
p336_326,We have great support.
p336_327,One would not want to go there anyway.
p336_328,And it's difficult to argue.
p336_329,We'll see what happens.
p336_330,That could be in place by next year.
p336_331,That's not part of the deal.
p336_332,There is a problem.
p336_333,He pretended not to care.
p336_334,"They are very concerned, and you can understand that."
p336_335,Not because they want to sing about something.
p336_336,Was it too obvious?
p336_337,Wouldn't it be nice?
p336_338,I was in tears in the street.
p336_339,"Eriksson, though, was having none of it."
p336_340,It is a terrible thing to have happened.
p336_343,The work was suspended following the kidnap.
p336_344,"Fifteen minutes later, they were found."
p336_345,That is why we are here.
p336_346,He wouldn't do it.
p336_347,She becomes a mother.
p336_348,He is very much respected within the group.
p336_349,People want to learn.
p336_350,Bomber was not amused.
p336_351,I am not a happy man.
p336_352,But it was fun.
p336_353,"Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't."
p336_354,No decisions have been made in this respect.
p336_355,It's been such a waste of money.
p336_356,"Not so, it transpires."
p336_357,Things don't look too good at the moment.
p336_358,"Inside, there is a kind of madness."
p336_359,I'd like to run.
p336_360,Its future is no longer in question.
p336_361,But this relative success has not been easy.
p336_362,I am a player.
p336_363,"I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't."
p336_364,He was not alone.
p336_365,There was too much at stake.
p336_366,Who wouldn't do it?
p336_368,"He was taken to hospital, but later died."
p336_369,Eriksson would have approved.
p336_370,We are all in the frontline.
p336_371,It looked like a war zone.
p336_372,His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p336_373,Further expansion is possible.
p336_374,Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p336_375,I'm interested in all kinds of history.
p336_376,At this point we can only speculate.
p336_377,We know we have the quality.
p336_378,"In fact, he should never have been in the field."
p336_379,It may be the first of many.
p336_380,It runs in cycles.
p336_381,It is already making a difference.
p336_382,I spoke to him yesterday.
p336_383,We are looking very hard at ourselves.
p336_384,This is the stuff of live music.
p336_385,We were beaten by the better team today.
p336_386,Taxes may need to rise.
p336_387,It's unusual to say the least.
p336_388,I was quietly confident about getting the win.
p336_389,I am not going to sit back.
p336_390,But this is even worse.
p336_391,It left me with a sadness.
p336_392,I was living with my mum.
p336_393,The truth is he probably doesn't.
p336_394,There were few surprises.
p336_395,He is a one-off.
p336_396,And then he laughs.
p336_397,She is having an affair with his partner.
p336_398,He put a lot of effort into it.
p336_399,The pressure is enormous.
p336_400,I am not that sadistic.
p336_401,Are you all right?
p336_402,We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p336_403,I'm certainly thinking about retirement.
p336_404,But we say Yes - and we are the people.
p336_405,Is it any good?
p336_406,The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p336_407,It would be that absurd.
p336_408,As if he would.
p336_409,I just carry on with my work.
p336_410,She made no further comment.
p336_411,His attacker has been a Rangers fan.
p336_412,He wants the festival to make a difference.
p336_413,"He didn't know it was his audition, but it was."
p336_415,The auction has seven days to run.
p336_416,It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
p336_417,They want to prove a point.
p336_418,It is my decision and my decision alone.
p336_419,Would he ever go back to the beginning?
p336_420,What is going on?
p336_421,Let that be their memorial.
p336_422,We thought we were looking in good shape.
p336_423,Tonight is very special.
p336_424,This is a matter of life and death.
