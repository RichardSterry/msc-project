p230_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p230_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p230_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p230_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p230_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p230_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p230_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p230_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p230_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p230_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p230_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p230_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p230_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p230_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p230_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p230_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p230_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p230_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p230_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p230_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p230_025,"It is on the internet.
"
p230_026,"Smoking is also very important.
"
p230_027,"He has the courage of the unaware.
"
p230_028,"Life was like a timetable.
"
p230_029,"It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
"
p230_030,"Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
"
p230_031,"I'm so happy that she did.
"
p230_032,"The wedding was in Edinburgh.
"
p230_033,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p230_034,"He really is a lovely man.
"
p230_035,"The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
"
p230_036,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p230_037,"The boy is no longer with us.
"
p230_038,"They said she was stable.
"
p230_039,"This will save interest charges.
"
p230_040,"Well, he is an artist.
"
p230_041,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p230_042,"People want to see me on the screen.
"
p230_043,"The big problem is the lack of grass.
"
p230_044,"That was the theory, anyway.
"
p230_045,"I was inspired by two things.
"
p230_046,"If not, he should go home.
"
p230_047,"I must take a seat.
"
p230_048,"It was bound to happen.
"
p230_049,"We have to bring in new players.
"
p230_050,"In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
"
p230_051,"I have made that offer.
"
p230_052,"None has ever been found.
"
p230_053,"Four other charges were dropped.
"
p230_054,"We should be able to cope.
"
p230_055,"There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
"
p230_056,"We will pay their bills.
"
p230_057,"You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
"
p230_058,"It was exactly four months away.
"
p230_059,"He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
"
p230_060,"It's not covered by the insurance.
"
p230_061,"But the challenge is in the US.
"
p230_062,"Robin Williams is very subdued.
"
p230_063,"The tournament has now been cancelled.
"
p230_064,"They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
"
p230_065,"Both sides have been hit by injury.
"
p230_066,"He also received a medal of honour.
"
p230_068,"It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
"
p230_069,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p230_070,"It looks like a hit.
"
p230_071,"What do we do ?
"
p230_072,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p230_073,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p230_074,"However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
"
p230_075,"After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
"
p230_076,"Consumer confidence remains an issue.
"
p230_077,"Last week, he was taken into hospital.
"
p230_078,"This is a true story.
"
p230_079,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p230_080,"It's so hard to shift.
"
p230_081,"They lived for their children.
"
p230_083,"It might change your life.
"
p230_084,"You are a great player.
"
p230_085,"However, it did not end that way.
"
p230_086,"We will deal with the refugees.
"
p230_087,"It was not an insult.
"
p230_088,"You might not make it.
"
p230_089,"However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
"
p230_090,"I did not have a bet on myself.
"
p230_091,"The conclusion is the same.
"
p230_092,"He was prepared for this.
"
p230_093,"But I know the course.
"
p230_094,"You are like an animal.
"
p230_095,"We intend to change the model.
"
p230_096,"It was some time before she found out he was safe.
"
p230_097,"Two of the team became ill.
"
p230_099,"It has been a nightmare of frustration.
"
p230_100,"But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
"
p230_101,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p230_102,"This was a good move for me.
"
p230_103,"It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
"
p230_104,"I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
"
p230_105,"It is close to call.
"
p230_106,"It is an impressive record.
"
p230_107,"It is a total and utter change of culture.
"
p230_108,"He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
"
p230_109,"Abbey National is an option.
"
p230_110,"The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem.
"
p230_112,"We have the mental strength.
"
p230_113,"You can spend money on housing.
"
p230_114,"That admission is not surprising.
"
p230_115,"I can't even get into the A team.
"
p230_116,"Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
"
p230_117,"Which can happen any time.
"
p230_118,"It is too pretty, it is too small.
"
p230_119,"But this time we can have no excuses.
"
p230_120,"They are very happy with the new settlement.
"
p230_121,"The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
"
p230_122,"Something will be done by corporate bodies.
"
p230_123,"We did what we had to do.
"
p230_124,"She was also very brave.
"
p230_125,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p230_126,"We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
"
p230_127,"The opposite is the case.
"
p230_128,"He was a home referee.
"
p230_129,"This is a successful outcome.
"
p230_130,"Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
"
p230_131,"She died at her home.
"
p230_132,"Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
"
p230_133,"Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
"
p230_134,"It was a piece of art.
"
p230_135,"I would relish the prospect.
"
p230_137,"These men are a part of India.
"
p230_138,"I was caught out a little bit.
"
p230_139,"The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
"
p230_140,"I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
"
p230_141,"It has to be an event.
"
p230_142,"It was deployed in the Gulf War.
"
p230_143,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p230_144,"The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done.
"
p230_145,"She has gone to the Catholic school.
"
p230_146,"It was by the numbers.
"
p230_147,"I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that.
"
p230_148,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p230_149,"However, he was later released without charge.
"
p230_150,"This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
"
p230_151,"These days are long gone.
"
p230_152,"I'm afraid to say anything.
"
p230_153,"We are still getting over it.
"
p230_154,"It has to be now.
"
p230_155,"It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
"
p230_156,"You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
"
p230_157,"They will do their own thing.
"
p230_158,"You had to go and see him.
"
p230_159,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p230_160,"And does it ?
"
p230_161,"Are you from the rugby ?
"
p230_162,"Had I heard ?
"
p230_163,"Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
"
p230_164,"Our position remains the same.
"
p230_165,"Nobody did in those days.
"
p230_166,"We believe in the medium term.
"
p230_167,"It's nice to be nice.
"
p230_168,"To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
"
p230_169,"On the month the weakness was across the board.
"
p230_170,"One season, they might do well.
"
p230_171,"Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
"
p230_172,"First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
"
p230_173,"But he has a lifeline.
"
p230_174,"Phase one was a shambles.
"
p230_175,"City sentiment is in his favour.
"
p230_176,"I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
"
p230_177,"At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
"
p230_178,"Tomorrow is a new day.
"
p230_179,"It makes no influence on the public.
"
p230_180,"She has left the island.
"
p230_181,"He played it like a veteran.
"
p230_182,"I have spoken to head office.
"
p230_183,"They will run a mile.
"
p230_184,"It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
"
p230_185,"Our destiny is in our own hands.
"
p230_186,"He prefers to play for them.
"
p230_188,"He lives in a neighbouring village.
"
p230_189,"It was an odd affair, in many respects.
"
p230_190,"It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
"
p230_191,"We represent a wide range of society.
"
p230_192,"We always felt we could win.
"
p230_194,"This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
"
p230_195,"It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
"
p230_196,"Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
"
p230_198,"I made a terrible start.
"
p230_199,"The result is called a patent.
"
p230_200,"We played them off the pitch.
"
p230_201,"Racism has no place in any sport.
"
p230_202,"Tommy is not a problem.
"
p230_203,"The sanctions are about collective punishment.
"
p230_204,"This is a holy place.
"
p230_205,"He had suffered a heart attack.
"
p230_206,"The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
"
p230_207,"We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
"
p230_208,"This will take several weeks.
"
p230_209,"The research is published in the journal, Nature.
"
p230_210,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p230_211,"Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
"
p230_212,"There is no quick fix.
"
p230_213,"All will be revealed in due course.
"
p230_214,"We used to live with dignity in our country.
"
p230_215,"The most exciting room is the final one of the show.
"
p230_216,"He has made his base in Spain.
"
p230_217,"My life is in the ballet.
"
p230_218,"Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
"
p230_219,"It's all change at Kilmarnock.
"
p230_220,"His second was a beauty.
"
p230_221,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p230_222,"Does the name matter ?
"
p230_223,"How do you get it back ?
"
p230_224,"What are you not good at ?
"
p230_225,"The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
"
p230_226,"However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
"
p230_227,"It was a day for records.
"
p230_228,"He remains a main board director of Royal.
"
p230_230,"That has been the easy part.
"
p230_231,"Things were so intense in the studio.
"
p230_232,"I was not sure whether I had won.
"
p230_233,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p230_234,"So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
"
p230_235,"It is the voice of the survivors.
"
p230_236,"It had so much to do with output.
"
p230_237,"Must have been at the bar.
"
p230_238,"She died in middle age.
"
p230_239,"No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
"
p230_240,"They need to win a trophy.
"
p230_241,"Half the young people had had contact with the police.
"
p230_242,"It is possible to be too good.
"
p230_243,"In many ways, that is as important.
"
p230_244,"Here is a question for you.
"
p230_245,"I was just a kid.
"
p230_246,"Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
"
p230_247,"Hospitals are for the ill.
"
p230_248,"However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
"
p230_249,"Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
"
p230_250,"We have to compete at our own level.
"
p230_251,"They showed a lot of heart.
"
p230_252,"This gives a financial incentive to switch.
"
p230_253,"It might be sad, but it's a fact.
"
p230_254,"She took them for a term.
"
p230_255,"Kingfisher can afford to wait.
"
p230_257,"Nato was not a love affair.
"
p230_258,"Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
"
p230_259,"Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
"
p230_260,"In fact, we were all over the shop.
"
p230_261,"You can feel at home in China.
"
p230_262,"Persuaded to change his mind.
"
p230_263,"Either way, the investor retains the premium.
"
p230_264,"It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
"
p230_265,"In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
"
p230_266,"Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
"
p230_267,"I should think so, too.
"
p230_268,"Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
"
p230_269,"I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board.
"
p230_270,"I was ready for this.
"
p230_271,"On the contrary they stand to gain.
"
p230_272,"They are interior designers and architects.
"
p230_273,"That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
"
p230_274,"We feel very good about it.
"
p230_276,"It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
"
p230_277,"It is also very valuable.
"
p230_278,"None of this work is guaranteed.
"
p230_279,"There is a case to answer.
"
p230_280,"We're trying to get rounded performers.
"
p230_281,"They can leave at any time.
"
p230_282,"And they were being paid ?
"
p230_283,"was everything done to save people ?
"
p230_284,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p230_285,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p230_286,"That was a gold medal for certain.
"
p230_287,"You get a lot for your money.
"
p230_288,"Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
"
p230_289,"In that moment, I was happy.
"
p230_290,"The actor has met with Mandela.
"
p230_291,"It was never a free kick.
"
p230_292,"It is a recipe for success.
"
p230_293,"I would rather look at him.
"
p230_295,"It's got to come from me.
"
p230_296,"It took a month and a half to film.
"
p230_297,"The cause of the accident remained unclear.
"
p230_298,"It is a symbolic concert.
"
p230_299,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p230_300,"Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
"
p230_302,"He is at war with his knee.
"
p230_303,"Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
"
p230_304,"I was there five months ago.
"
p230_305,"You have to see it like this.
"
p230_306,"Rugby is now just like football.
"
p230_307,"It could well be military.
"
p230_308,"His job was not advertised.
"
p230_309,"There is an element of racism in Scotland.
"
p230_310,"We have a clean bill of health.
"
p230_311,"And we can do it.
"
p230_312,"The songs are just so good.
"
p230_313,"The casting is as perfect.
"
p230_314,"I can hardly believe it.
"
p230_315,"I must do something about it.
"
p230_316,"Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
"
p230_317,"If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
"
p230_318,"They are not left wing.
"
p230_319,"McNaughton was not so sure.
"
p230_321,"It is a road of death.
"
p230_322,"The party lasted all night.
"
p230_323,"The group is not paying a dividend.
"
p230_324,"We were on our way.
"
p230_325,"I was as strong as a horse.
"
p230_326,"That meant the search was unlawful.
"
p230_327,"We have a good healthy debate.
"
p230_328,"I would do away with the dress code.
"
p230_329,"We are on a four-year mission.
"
p230_330,"This is a historic occasion.
"
p230_331,"This ruling is a farce.
"
p230_332,"I can see their argument.
"
p230_333,"After some discussion they did.
"
p230_334,"It was always an option.
"
p230_335,"Does that put pressure on us ?
"
p230_336,"Did it work ?
"
p230_337,"Do you think we are a top nation ?
"
p230_338,"Public opinion was split on the proposal.
"
p230_339,"The election is total confusion and chaos.
"
p230_340,"You may have a short memory.
"
p230_341,"Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
"
p230_342,"In the old days, it was easy.
"
p230_343,"There was some merit in that.
"
p230_344,"That is a trend which will be encouraged.
"
p230_345,"The airport was even different.
"
p230_346,"Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
"
p230_347,"We think all other measures are not exhausted.
"
p230_348,"There was no time scale.
"
p230_349,"Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
"
p230_350,"On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
"
p230_351,"He is not very big, either.
"
p230_352,"I have a moral dilemma.
"
p230_353,"Even the one she loved.
"
p230_354,"You have no chance of planning permission.
"
p230_355,"We are encouraged by the news.
"
p230_356,"In addition, certain areas closed at certain times.
"
p230_357,"The professor said the results were positive.
"
p230_358,"In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
"
p230_359,"Three years ago he would have been.
"
p230_360,"Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
"
p230_361,"The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
"
p230_362,"I am a lucky man.
"
p230_363,"Nobody else was with me.
"
p230_364,"We put our bid in last night.
"
p230_365,"Alex Ferguson is the same.
"
p230_366,"George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
"
p230_367,"But BA said the prediction was premature.
"
p230_368,"Like his acting, it was an accident.
"
p230_369,"They have broken the promise.
"
p230_370,"We are really good friends.
"
p230_371,"My goal is quite simple.
"
p230_372,"This is a major championship.
"
p230_373,"It's going to be fun.
"
p230_374,"She is now on the back benches.
"
p230_375,"Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited.
"
p230_376,"This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
"
