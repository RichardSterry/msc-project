p376_002,"""Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  """
p376_003,"""Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  """
p376_004,"""We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  """
p376_005,"""She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. """
p376_006,"""When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. """
p376_007,"""The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. """
p376_008,"""These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. """
p376_009,"""There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. """
p376_010,"""People look, but no one ever finds it. """
p376_011,"""When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. """
p376_012,"""Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. """
p376_013,"""Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. """
p376_014,"""To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. """
p376_015,"""The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. """
p376_016,"""The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. """
p376_017,"""Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. """
p376_018,"""Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. """
p376_019,"""Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. """
p376_020,"""Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. """
p376_021,"""The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. """
p376_022,"""The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. """
p376_023,"""If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. """
p376_024,"""This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."""
