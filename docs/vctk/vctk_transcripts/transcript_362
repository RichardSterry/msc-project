p362_001,Please call Stella.
p362_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p362_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p362_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p362_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p362_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p362_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p362_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p362_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p362_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p362_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p362_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p362_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p362_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p362_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p362_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p362_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p362_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p362_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p362_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p362_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p362_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p362_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p362_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p362_025,We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p362_026,This is your country.
p362_027,Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p362_028,I feel really good.
p362_029,It was a fairy tale.
p362_030,But there are no plans.
p362_031,They responded in the most positive way.
p362_032,I have a very strong opinion about this.
p362_033,The British government said she was coming home.
p362_034,We are a peaceful people.
p362_035,His mother was English.
p362_036,He was jailed for five years.
p362_037,It's not Big Brother at sea.
p362_038,Was this a new event?
p362_039,To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p362_040,They had a confession.
p362_041,"As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall."
p362_042,The chances were plentiful.
p362_043,They were impressive against France.
p362_044,This is only one example.
p362_045,His style is suited to Scottish football.
p362_046,The cause is just.
p362_047,I am so upset.
p362_048,"England could not take anything for granted, however."
p362_049,They finished second and third.
p362_050,But this was refused.
p362_051,"Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe."
p362_052,Hasn't let anyone down?
p362_053,"We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect."
p362_054,We certainly hope we have been successful.
p362_055,He is one of them.
p362_056,This was no accident.
p362_057,He is a law unto himself.
p362_058,It is a sign of hope.
p362_059,With him are the symbols of his faith.
p362_060,They're interested only in profits.
p362_061,And there has been a good start.
p362_062,I feel my parents are in New York.
p362_063,Policing the profession is important.
p362_064,Seems a sensible compromise.
p362_065,She had no chance.
p362_066,"In the meantime, you just have to get on with it."
p362_067,I don't have a problem with it.
p362_068,How is he enjoying life as a senior?
p362_069,It's more relaxing this way.
p362_070,Allison is not convinced.
p362_071,We have to move forward from now on.
p362_072,And it was this one.
p362_073,I am going to win the next two.
p362_074,She's afraid of life.
p362_075,But there is good and bad.
p362_076,The real problem is the Usher Hall.
p362_077,That is her job.
p362_078,They have broken that promise.
p362_079,I don't know what it means.
p362_080,I found the course inspiring.
p362_081,I have to accept that.
p362_082,It means the margin for error is tight.
p362_083,I thought he was part of the camera.
p362_084,She is now on the back benches.
p362_085,It is not a road of life.
p362_086,Three bystanders were killed.
p362_087,"One is investment, one is reform."
p362_088,They could not have done more for me.
p362_089,There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p362_090,It benefits the whole family.
p362_091,It's not my fault.
p362_092,My husband was angry.
p362_093,"Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported."
p362_094,Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p362_095,"Sure, this is a very important event for me."
p362_096,They have to work so hard.
p362_097,"Well, was it?"
p362_098,I thought he was my friend.
p362_099,What kind of person is he?
p362_100,There's a strong involvement.
p362_101,This is complete nonsense.
p362_102,This Government is cutting taxes.
p362_103,The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p362_104,They know their son was murdered.
p362_105,Most of them were one-year conscripts.
p362_106,"So is that it, then?"
p362_107,The task is enormous.
p362_108,I know he meant it.
p362_109,"A, The media has been great."
p362_110,There have been so many.
p362_111,Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p362_112,"Of course, it is nonsense."
p362_113,I've never felt affection for Emu.
p362_114,He had returned to die.
p362_115,Anyone can take a photo.
p362_116,He is involved in everything.
p362_117,No person was charged.
p362_118,"You see, my back has gone."
p362_119,He's a nice guy.
p362_120,The fire was still coming down.
p362_121,It's always the way.
p362_122,I got the surprise of my life.
p362_123,It will be tight.
p362_124,He seems to be used to the attention.
p362_125,Both are national treasures.
p362_126,"I accept that, but it is very upsetting."
p362_127,"Well, you don't have time."
p362_128,I had never done anything like it before.
p362_129,I feel it's time to make the switch.
p362_130,But he thought the overall results were good.
p362_131,Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p362_132,I had been hoping for justice.
p362_133,Labour is providing none of these.
p362_134,The building was starting to come down.
p362_135,No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
p362_136,There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
p362_137,There is a subtle difference.
p362_138,He has created the confusion.
p362_139,He didn't get out much.
p362_140,She was very different.
p362_141,That is my dream.
p362_142,Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
p362_143,The problem is not confined to Glasgow.
p362_144,"Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds."
p362_145,The choice is simple.
p362_146,Who is going to pay their wages?
p362_147,I don't think we deserved to lose.
p362_148,It was that kind of match.
p362_149,We couldn't believe it at first.
p362_150,"Feel the air, the space."
p362_151,I have nothing to regret.
p362_152,"Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time."
p362_153,"A century on, little has changed."
p362_154,Wrong decisions Address in full
p362_155,I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
p362_156,He is having a nightmare.
p362_157,And he still is.
p362_158,"However, the story has a happy ending."
p362_159,You never had it so good.
p362_160,"Even for a British Open, this is different."
p362_161,Then he did it twice.
p362_162,So is the rest of British sport.
p362_163,Genetic assessment is crucial.
p362_164,It was his greatest movie performance.
p362_165,We go back a long way.
p362_166,"So, easy does it."
p362_167,Not that he's declined.
p362_168,People also have trouble with the currency.
p362_169,I always wanted her to be happy.
p362_170,We've got to get back to normal.
p362_171,Do we want to see it?
p362_172,That is for certain.
p362_173,An inquiry has begun.
p362_174,I was a little surprised.
p362_175,"That is not, however, the case."
p362_176,Only two players have done it.
p362_177,He is a master of deceit and delay.
p362_178,"He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth."
p362_179,What was that all about?
p362_180,This is a fine appointment.
p362_181,That was the finest moment in my career.
p362_182,England will be quite prepared.
p362_183,He is appealing to women.
p362_184,There is no conflict of interest.
p362_185,She has the biggest part.
p362_186,Film music was never the same again.
p362_187,It was a deeply moving musical experience.
p362_188,I thought he was at fault.
p362_189,The First Minister is an addict.
p362_190,We will win this tie.
p362_191,I think he's done it a few times.
p362_192,Something happened on that island.
p362_193,This is a business.
p362_194,"Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister."
p362_195,I never had any real direction at school.
p362_196,That's how it works.
p362_197,"It is quite a young team, so the future is there."
p362_198,Do what you want to do.
p362_199,We know the quality of life goes up.
p362_200,Who are the public?
p362_201,"When it is ready, it will be signed."
p362_203,But we have learned that it doesn't.
p362_204,I'm looking forward to coming home.
p362_205,They should not be blamed for it.
p362_206,"He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk."
p362_207,Glasgow is a very welcoming place.
p362_208,It was crucial strike.
p362_209,I have no secrets.
p362_210,What do you want to say?
p362_211,I was so relieved.
p362_212,They continue to do so.
p362_213,I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p362_214,It is a worry.
p362_215,"We are not a retailer, we provide a service."
p362_216,That is highly unfair.
p362_217,They are not the answer to staff shortages.
p362_218,Gas is too expensive.
p362_219,This plan is an agenda for action.
p362_220,It was all relative.
p362_221,"And, within itself, it is visionary."
p362_222,Are you up for business?
p362_223,"It is true, but it is only part of the issue."
p362_224,You are not in any kind of trouble.
p362_225,It also makes for interesting viewing.
p362_226,Life becomes a song.
p362_227,No wonder he missed the conversion.
p362_228,"Sadly, they did not."
p362_229,We have nowhere to go.
p362_230,He has every right to do that.
p362_231,"Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights."
p362_232,That had never happened.
p362_233,"However, our players will fight for that."
p362_234,They are not suitable.
p362_235,He is advised that he has done so.
p362_236,You mean he didn't get the girl?
p362_237,"He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline."
p362_238,The Prime Minister has been in touch.
p362_239,But the killing will continue.
p362_240,They've got to get better.
p362_241,But we are working together for this result.
p362_242,Mental health is a massive issue.
p362_243,It doesn't make them evil.
p362_244,We don't want to be too intrusive.
p362_245,The most important thing is the game.
p362_246,He said nothing of the sort.
p362_247,This would give Scotland around eight members.
p362_248,"In saying that, you just have to get on with it."
p362_249,The door is open.
p362_250,Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p362_251,Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
p362_252,"Lara is very, very much a girl."
p362_253,So what went wrong?
p362_254,We did not play well.
p362_255,We are in a very strong position.
p362_256,This will have no effect on the championship.
p362_257,That is the key.
p362_258,"So, how did you do?"
p362_259,"Well, until recently he didn't think so."
p362_260,"It was, however, the wrong side."
p362_261,I can't deny that fact.
p362_262,She is now planning a visit.
p362_263,We could have done without this.
p362_264,Boy is the town a mess.
p362_265,Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p362_266,He's a great dealer.
p362_267,"Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge."
p362_268,I want to concentrate on the real issues.
p362_269,"He is an excellent defender, strong and quick."
p362_270,We are moving on.
p362_271,This is not a crisis.
p362_272,There's always a chance.
p362_273,"I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans."
p362_274,"For me, it's a tension you can feel."
p362_275,"For some, it might not make too much difference."
p362_276,That's a very serious matter.
p362_277,They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p362_278,But it was to no avail.
p362_279,"Sad to say, it's still waiting."
p362_280,It has been a major success.
p362_281,It takes a bit of working out.
p362_282,"I want my country to be a republic, not an empire."
p362_283,But it didn't bother me.
p362_284,I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p362_285,I'm very relaxed about that indeed.
p362_286,He will not be coming back.
p362_287,He is also a great finisher.
p362_288,I don't see any problem.
p362_289,It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p362_290,Yet it seemed to work.
p362_291,Let us hope it doesn't come to that.
p362_292,I have never felt so well.
p362_293,There are other things going on.
p362_294,All is now forgiven.
p362_295,So who is right?
p362_296,And this tournament will travel.
p362_297,There will be new memories.
p362_298,"Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop."
p362_299,We know the goals will come.
p362_300,How can they get one?
p362_301,It was an insult.
p362_302,But we all have to look at ourselves.
p362_303,We have nothing to hide.
p362_304,"He added, We are full of anger."
p362_305,He did it all for us.
p362_306,I don't think that is good enough.
p362_307,Of course it is.
p362_308,We all make mistakes.
p362_309,It was published yesterday on the internet.
p362_310,That is my commitment.
p362_311,This is the only problem with the story.
p362_312,It is good football in Scotland.
p362_313,Knowledge is everything at this level.
p362_314,Is that right?
p362_315,So other options had to be explored.
p362_316,They should be so lucky.
p362_317,He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p362_318,It is good news for us.
p362_319,The timing is obvious.
p362_320,"He's a good player, but he's not the only one."
p362_321,"Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often."
p362_322,I don't think it's very real.
p362_323,Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p362_324,I think she was right.
p362_325,Is that what people want?
p362_326,"CHRISTMAS is special, a time for reflection."
p362_327,I'd like to continue that record.
p362_328,It will be a new experience.
p362_329,The process itself has taken over.
p362_330,She asked for the appointment with me.
p362_331,The time commitment is the biggest thing.
p362_332,It is quite hard to track.
p362_333,It's not going to last five minutes.
p362_334,But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p362_335,Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p362_336,I am sure all schools would accept that.
p362_337,It was quite an ordeal for them.
p362_338,There are a number of possible outcomes.
p362_339,Doesn't matter what you do.
p362_340,O no it's not!
p362_341,The result could be all down to turnout.
p362_342,They are in good spirits.
p362_343,Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p362_344,He was their leader.
p362_345,The support of Britain is assumed.
p362_346,So far he has not done so.
p362_347,Maybe they will show it next year.
p362_348,They are a very good team.
p362_349,So there we are.
p362_350,And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p362_351,It doesn't make me feel any better.
p362_352,The conversion didn't go over either.
p362_353,The incident is dead.
p362_354,We are delighted with the result.
p362_355,It will take time.
p362_356,They will do something big.
p362_357,The programme was awful.
p362_358,It is having a big impact.
p362_359,"That is very hard, alone."
p362_360,I am feeling on top of the world.
p362_361,Doesn't he miss it?
p362_362,The same goes for Russia.
p362_363,They went down together.
p362_364,Cooking is intricate and complex.
p362_365,"One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services."
p362_366,We were getting very worried.
p362_367,"Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued."
p362_368,You can't really compare.
p362_369,We thought we were looking in good shape.
p362_370,Plot is not the issue.
p362_371,We need to increase the membership.
p362_372,"Certainly, there is much on the agenda."
p362_373,We should not be complacent.
p362_374,We all want the same things.
p362_375,Maybe his time has gone.
p362_376,She died in hospital two hours later.
p362_377,"Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help."
p362_378,"SO, that is it for another year."
p362_379,The results are tragic.
p362_380,We are not getting him back.
p362_381,He was on a horse.
p362_382,Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p362_383,"I told her, and she was extremely grateful."
p362_384,There may be reasons for it.
p362_385,He had taken everything from me.
p362_386,It's a good offer by any standards.
p362_387,"Yes, it took time to recover."
p362_388,The potential is always in the idea.
p362_389,I am not a frustrated actor.
p362_390,No progress has been made.
p362_391,He can win every week.
p362_392,This makes up for it.
p362_393,My mind was made up.
p362_394,The plot is changing as time goes on.
p362_395,I never got anything out of it.
p362_396,It is patently true.
p362_397,Locate in Scotland also refused to comment.
p362_398,"But don't just take my word, for it."
p362_399,That is why he is so special.
p362_400,You hope he prevails.
p362_401,My mother was getting on at me.
p362_402,This is a very serious matter.
p362_403,It's going to be great!
p362_404,That's a good sign.
p362_405,I'd never heard anything like it before.
p362_406,He added that he felt undermined.
p362_407,"Hopefully, it will be good enough."
p362_408,He declined to be more specific.
p362_409,But it looks good for next year.
p362_410,Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p362_411,We want everyone to have a good time.
p362_412,We're going to rebuild.
p362_413,We are trying to do it properly.
p362_414,We actually had a laugh about that.
p362_415,It raises the edge.
p362_416,He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p362_417,I had no idea.
p362_418,As indeed it did.
p362_419,We made a world record together.
p362_420,They were outside the circle.
p362_421,I want to help other women.
p362_422,He got the part.
p362_423,"Or, rather, it isn't."
p362_424,He refused to name the survivors.
