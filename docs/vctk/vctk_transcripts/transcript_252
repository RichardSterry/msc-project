p252_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p252_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p252_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p252_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p252_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p252_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p252_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p252_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p252_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p252_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p252_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p252_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p252_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p252_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p252_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p252_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p252_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p252_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p252_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p252_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p252_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p252_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-position of a number of bows. 
"
p252_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p252_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p252_025,"Then nine minutes before half time Kenny Miller struck.
"
p252_026,"This would include insurance.
"
p252_027,"It would fit very well with us.
"
p252_028,"He does not even trust his own members.
"
p252_029,"Do not give your details to anyone.
"
p252_030,"Schools do not create that.
"
p252_032,"The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
"
p252_033,"Just look at his fashion sense.
"
p252_034,"I have every confidence.
"
p252_035,"He added that her comments were noted.
"
p252_036,"We've got a real battle now with Richard.
"
p252_037,"Instead, we make the ground pay.
"
p252_038,"That time may never be broken.
"
p252_039,"Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
"
p252_040,"He too started on the subs seats.
"
p252_041,"I'm so happy that she did.
"
p252_042,"We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
"
p252_043,"This operation will change her life.
"
p252_044,"Something old something new, as it were.
"
p252_045,"The youngsters have put us in a strong position.
"
p252_046,"They seem too much of a sure thing.
"
p252_047,"That's what set him apart.
"
p252_048,"You must always attempt to raise the bar.
"
p252_050,"The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
"
p252_051,"She continued to enjoy sport.
"
p252_052,"Downing Street also rejected the calls for a European army.
"
p252_053,"By all accounts he was delighted.
"
p252_054,"Schools will not want change.
"
p252_055,"I think I'm a bit too young.
"
p252_056,"He was failed by his health authority.
"
p252_057,"We wish to win, but not at any price.
"
p252_058,"I agree with you about this.
"
p252_059,"Or so he thought.
"
p252_060,"Must be prepared to use it.
"
p252_061,"The fifth was found later.
"
p252_062,"For a decade she was proved right.
"
p252_063,"It was dangerous but vital employment.
"
p252_064,"Our people are ready.
"
p252_065,"These figures cover the major British banking groups.
"
p252_066,"Probably he wasn't thinking at all.
"
p252_067,"Some of their players seemed almost dead.
"
p252_068,"People come to see the Highlands.
"
p252_069,"It would have to be.
"
p252_071,"This is a great opportunity for us.
"
p252_072,"That is not possible.
"
p252_073,"None has ever been found.
"
p252_074,"Insurance will perhaps reduce.
"
p252_075,"Their time has gone.
"
p252_076,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p252_077,"How are you, sir ?
"
p252_078,"So is that it, then ?
"
p252_079,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p252_080,"What do we do ?
"
p252_081,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p252_082,"What kind of a man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p252_083,"Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
"
p252_084,"He has a real potential.
"
p252_085,"LET there be light.
"
p252_086,"I can't remember a lot about the accident.
"
p252_087,"Scotland has great assets.
"
p252_088,"That remains the same.
"
p252_089,"It was exactly four months away.
"
p252_090,"There is no issue of national security involved here.
"
p252_091,"Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
"
p252_092,"Put simply, it goes something like this.
"
p252_093,"Even if he doesn't have any lines.
"
p252_094,"The car driver died.
"
p252_095,"It looks that way.
"
p252_096,"Now comes the hard part.
"
p252_097,"We are already seeing some positive results.
"
p252_098,"We're at home, which is important.
"
p252_099,"They prepared some food very quickly.
"
p252_100,"The circumstances have changed since last year.
"
p252_101,"In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.
"
p252_102,"They had three children.
"
p252_103,"Some young girls also came by last night.
"
p252_104,"The idea is the shop within a shop.
"
p252_105,"It would be easy to think so.
"
p252_106,"And so it went on.
"
p252_108,"Scotland were on Saturday.
"
p252_109,"We want the results as soon as possible before Thursday.
"
p252_110,"He gets his moment.
"
p252_111,"The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.
"
p252_112,"There was no reason.
"
p252_113,"It gets too much.
"
p252_114,"So they should be.
"
p252_115,"No progress has been made.
"
p252_116,"They need the money.
"
p252_117,"That is the only way to rate players.
"
p252_118,"Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
"
p252_119,"Its failure is no surprise.
"
p252_120,"No country has a similar training programme.
"
p252_121,"Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
"
p252_122,"Consumers will also benefit.
"
p252_123,"They pointed to the site.
"
p252_124,"Tony Blair said as little.
"
p252_125,"He is at peace with himself.
"
p252_126,"Gold admitted as much.
"
p252_127,"It seemed like four hours.
"
p252_128,"Evidence must not be held back.
"
p252_129,"We beat the Welsh team.
"
p252_130,"I saw a lot of good things against Livingston.
"
p252_131,"Britain's role was to stop it.
"
p252_132,"The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
"
p252_133,"Eight others have followed.
"
p252_134,"We're currently looking at the level of support.
"
p252_135,"Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
"
p252_136,"Strong growth is expected from the industrial services division.
"
p252_137,"It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
"
p252_138,"No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
"
p252_139,"It should have its own network.
"
p252_140,"As our national coach, Brown is done for.
"
p252_141,"But this wasn't the full picture.
"
p252_142,"That shows the impact it had.
"
p252_143,"Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
"
p252_144,"I'd always wanted to act.
"
p252_145,"We hope he will do until he finally does the double.
"
p252_146,"That is a big risk at any price.
"
p252_147,"I am never fully fit.
"
p252_148,"Are you going to win ?
"
p252_149,"Was it the wife ?
"
p252_150,"Why change it ?
"
p252_151,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p252_152,"Does the name matter ?
"
p252_153,"how do you get it back ?
"
p252_154,"What are you not good at ?
"
p252_155,"I think, therefore I am ?
"
p252_156,"Who was she ?
"
p252_157,"He said some things which were better left alone.
"
p252_158,"He nearly killed my son.
"
p252_160,"Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
"
p252_161,"I told them during their morning break.
"
p252_162,"Parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.
"
p252_163,"Mr Dewar understood that.
"
p252_164,"Nato has left them with no other option.
"
p252_165,"They have shown great character.
"
p252_166,"I am secure in my own position.
"
p252_167,"It wasn't a pretty match.
"
p252_168,"Health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.
"
p252_169,"Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
"
p252_170,"The second failed completely.
"
p252_171,"That apart, though, I feel good.
"
p252_172,"We have come a long way since then.
"
p252_173,"Sport is good for you.
"
p252_174,"It was clearly not a battle.
"
p252_175,"I made my mind up before we came on tour.
"
p252_176,"You are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.
"
p252_177,"I'd rather be in our position than Rangers.
"
p252_178,"All options are available.
"
p252_179,"I knew Donald Dewar.
"
p252_181,"Parents do not know very much about drugs.
"
p252_182,"Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
"
p252_183,"I've no idea how it works.
"
p252_184,"It is actually building on the existing business.
"
p252_185,"Maybe this battle had been.
"
p252_186,"Art can challenge our value system.
"
p252_187,"It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
"
p252_188,"London remained the favourite.
"
p252_189,"I've never had a year like this.
"
p252_190,"He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
"
p252_191,"She really suffered for her art.
"
p252_193,"We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
"
p252_194,"A child is not a product.
"
p252_195,"Which can happen any time.
"
p252_196,"Scottish Life was there over one year.
"
p252_197,"Now he is back on top again.
"
p252_198,"The hotel was huge.
"
p252_199,"And they were being paid ?
"
p252_200,"was everything done to save people ?
"
p252_201,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p252_202,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p252_203,"Is it in the right place ?
"
p252_204,"Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
"
p252_205,"This should begin in October.
"
p252_206,"There remains some Scottish influence, however.
"
p252_207,"My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
"
p252_208,"The role was perfect for Russell.
"
p252_209,"The price was raised after massive demands from retail investors.
"
p252_210,"If not, a deal could take many months.
"
p252_211,"Their bodies were never found.
"
p252_212,"It plans to return to this field.
"
p252_213,"Business will continue as usual.
"
p252_214,"I want a free vote.
"
p252_215,"Fine, said the press officer.
"
p252_216,"The questions came quick and fast.
"
p252_217,"The Boys can speak about little else.
"
p252_218,"Her experience is certainly limited.
"
p252_219,"We tried four banks.
"
p252_220,"There is no doubt there's room for us.
"
p252_221,"The labour side had developed in the North area.
"
p252_222,"Good records have also been recognised by successful farmers.
"
p252_223,"Brian was last to join.
"
p252_224,"He has many offers from the English Premiership.
"
p252_225,"Now the door has opened.
"
p252_226,"I'd rather play well next week than here.
"
p252_227,"Her death is a huge blow.
"
p252_228,"The global market was about flat.
"
p252_229,"Three hit the target.
"
p252_230,"The idea is simple.
"
p252_231,"Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
"
p252_232,"It's used by Ayr Technical College.
"
p252_233,"The Queen was on the ball yesterday but off the Euro.
"
p252_234,"We know the problems.
"
p252_235,"Britain will be little affected.
"
p252_236,"There is a good reason for this.
"
p252_237,"You know the type.
"
p252_238,"The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
"
p252_239,"The board do not own the company.
"
p252_240,"That time is not far away.
"
p252_241,"That's been the difference between the sides.
"
p252_242,"When I was training.
"
p252_243,"I did let myself down a bit.
"
p252_244,"One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
"
p252_245,"This is absolutely not true.
"
p252_246,"Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
"
p252_247,"It was a great evening.
"
p252_248,"We have several options.
"
p252_250,"Our focus remains on quality revenue.
"
p252_251,"Perhaps it will happen again.
"
p252_252,"The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
"
p252_253,"It is based on population rather than need.
"
p252_254,"We were leading by two goals.
"
p252_255,"It had happened on average once a week this year.
"
p252_256,"It is very much in the eye of the individual.
"
p252_258,"It was an accident.
"
p252_260,"My goals have never changed.
"
p252_262,"So we kept them waiting.
"
p252_263,"He makes time for everyone.
"
p252_264,"That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
"
p252_265,"The proposal was rejected.
"
p252_266,"Look at a computer.
"
p252_267,"He did better then.
"
p252_268,"But the next day she paid for it.
"
p252_269,"We still think this trade is on the increase.
"
p252_270,"It is also hoped big name stars could be brought on board.
"
p252_271,"This was the perfect setting.
"
p252_273,"The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
"
p252_274,"The long-term trend is equally clear.
"
p252_275,"I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.
"
p252_276,"All films open tomorrow
"
p252_277,"If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
"
p252_278,"Paul never gave up hope.
"
p252_279,"Those three goals in five minutes changed the game.
"
p252_280,"They bought the property four years ago.
"
p252_281,"I hope numbers will be up on last time.
"
p252_282,"Their only score of the half came from a penalty by Jones.
"
p252_283,"It is a dangerous sport.
"
p252_284,"Oil stocks also provided a boost.
"
p252_286,"The future might well be green after all.
"
p252_287,"They were seriously after him.
"
p252_288,"It was a bit like having children.
"
p252_289,"Aberdeen had little to offer.
"
p252_290,"Donald felt it would be an appropriate thing to do.
"
p252_291,"I'm interested in interesting work.
"
p252_292,"His season started this afternoon.
"
p252_293,"He is a good signing for Rangers.
"
p252_294,"White would like to buy further bus businesses.
"
p252_295,"Kenny and I are ready.
"
p252_296,"Friday night was a pretty good night.
"
p252_297,"He also worked on general building contracts in the area.
"
p252_298,"They have played their part.
"
p252_299,"He followed the Italian route.
"
p252_300,"Stephen had never considered the question of compensation.
"
p252_301,"The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
"
p252_302,"So does every industry.
"
p252_303,"Tomorrow will be my last.
"
p252_304,"But there's also a love for the songs.
"
p252_305,"His career may also provide food for thought for Ferguson.
"
p252_306,"We must move on.
"
p252_307,"It's just an area of water.
"
p252_308,"We have achieved that.
"
p252_309,"Their eyes, however, told a different story.
"
p252_310,"Good players have become bad.
"
p252_311,"Many events are down on numbers.
"
p252_312,"He had served his time.
"
p252_313,"It was a total surprise.
"
p252_314,"If a service doesn't pay it will go.
"
p252_315,"The process will start tomorrow.
"
p252_316,"Motherwell took them from half chances.
"
p252_317,"That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
"
p252_319,"One finding emerged clearly.
"
p252_320,"There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
"
p252_321,"We lost to a poor team.
"
p252_322,"We are keen to see truth and justice.
"
p252_323,"We have clearly become well established.
"
p252_324,"The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
"
p252_325,"Murray plays down return
"
p252_326,"Other teams moved up too.
"
p252_327,"Not one person spoke badly.
"
p252_328,"We were caught out.
"
p252_329,"The performance continues to improve.
"
p252_330,"We want immediate action.
"
p252_331,"Our relationship has been very good.
"
p252_332,"Someone should tell them.
"
p252_333,"But it won't help British farmers.
"
p252_334,"Does that put pressure on us ?
"
p252_335,"Did it work ?
"
p252_336,"Do you think we are a top nation ?
"
p252_337,"Is our children learning ?
"
p252_338,"How independent is that ?
"
p252_339,"Because I think it's there.
"
p252_340,"If we get the wrong candidate.
"
p252_341,"They emerged before the patients left hospital.
"
p252_342,"They will now remain split up.
"
p252_343,"We are a husband and wife team.
"
p252_344,"It was the September weekend after all.
"
p252_345,"He would add value.
"
p252_346,"Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
"
p252_347,"Those overseas offices were great.
"
p252_348,"That was our last chance to do something.
"
p252_349,"Maybe she is right.
"
p252_350,"I saw one man vote five times.
"
p252_351,"No plans for projects are yet in place.
"
p252_352,"No sport needs that sort of thing.
"
p252_353,"The senior management team will be drawn from both companies.
"
p252_354,"Any increase always has some effect.
"
p252_355,"What form did that take ?
"
p252_356,"Are they free ?
"
p252_357,"What are they for ?
"
p252_358,"Is there a waiting list ?
"
p252_359,"Do they think anyone else wants them ?
"
p252_360,"They had better be.
"
p252_361,"Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
"
p252_362,"He was a great human being.
"
p252_363,"That seems highly unlikely.
"
p252_364,"Still, I am delighted.
"
p252_365,"Analysts welcomed the news.
"
p252_366,"He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
"
p252_367,"You will lose benefit because you have broken the rules.
"
p252_368,"They made such decisions in London.
"
p252_369,"Results of the survey are expected by the end of June.
"
p252_370,"The whole system is too complex.
"
p252_371,"He said legal action could be considered.
"
p252_372,"The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
"
p252_373,"This is far too high.
"
p252_374,"These matters can't just be medical decisions.
"
p252_375,"If you believe in the blue and white.
