p278_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p278_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p278_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p278_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p278_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p278_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p278_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p278_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p278_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p278_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p278_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p278_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p278_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p278_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p278_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p278_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p278_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p278_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p278_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p278_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p278_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p278_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p278_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p278_025,"A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
"
p278_026,"These decisions are not simple.

"
p278_184,"It is vital to clarify their role.
"
p278_185,"It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.

"
p278_187,"Says the Duke of York.
"
p278_188,"That's not fair to the supporters.

p278_192,"They were seriously after him.
"
p278_193,"But there's an upturn in the sector.
"
p278_194,"It shows the strength of the roots.
"
p278_195,"It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
"
p278_196,"It caused a lot of upset.
"
p278_197,"However, this idea is never developed.
