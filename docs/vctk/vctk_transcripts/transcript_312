p312_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p312_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p312_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p312_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p312_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p312_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p312_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p312_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p312_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p312_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p312_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p312_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p312_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p312_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p312_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p312_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p312_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p312_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p312_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.
p312_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increase as the size of the drops increases."
p312_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p312_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p312_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p312_025,Perhaps that was their mistake.
p312_026,This was a rationing decision.
p312_027,The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p312_028,He is doing the right things.
p312_029,Blood samples were taken.
p312_030,I've got the poster.
p312_031,This is excellent news for the workforce.
p312_032,We have a high quality product.
p312_033,Haven't been so lucky since.
p312_034,"Well, you might have a point."
p312_035,It was quite distressing for the crew.
p312_036,Now the show is for public consumption.
p312_037,That decision is now being appealed.
p312_038,This is really good news for us.
p312_039,"I wish it wasn't so, but it is."
p312_040,"Not so, it transpires."
p312_041,I shouldn't have put up with it.
p312_042,I think so - he seems to be in good health.
p312_043,I think it must be the uniforms.
p312_044,This is not a monument to the past.
p312_045,I certainly hope not.
p312_046,"However, there could be more bad weather to come."
p312_047,I feel pretty good.
p312_048,The group will report back in the summer.
p312_049,Back then it was hard to refuse.
p312_050,"Hopefully, it will be built by next year."
p312_051,I was in the zone in the morning.
p312_052,We have to break that cycle.
p312_053,"In fact, it might just be the beginning."
p312_054,The children are being very brave.
p312_055,They have a car and cannot afford another.
p312_056,My only concern is for my children.
p312_057,This is welcome news.
p312_058,The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p312_059,The trust has no magic wand.
p312_060,We just wish they had done so before.
p312_061,It was a virus.
p312_062,"The rest, of course, is history."
p312_063,They chose the latter.
p312_064,"I've not said anything to them, they know."
p312_065,All were later allowed home.
p312_066,Will you just put it away?
p312_067,I think it's more important to have fun.
p312_068,Who did the recruiting?
p312_069,It is still with Ministers.
p312_070,The effect was almost magical.
p312_071,"It happened again, and again, and again."
p312_072,It showed him the way to drive.
p312_073,I am still waiting for a reply.
p312_074,"After this, they were always in the driving seat."
p312_075,Were they under-age?
p312_076,He was charged with perjury.
p312_077,"I started it, but then forgot all about it."
p312_078,"However, there would be no permanent displays."
p312_079,The goal will come.
p312_080,He could hardly have been in greater demand.
p312_081,We didn't take our chances.
p312_082,It was all very proper and civilised.
p312_083,I've played them all in the Champions League.
p312_084,There are many children.
p312_085,That never seemed likely.
p312_086,Action must be taken urgently.
p312_087,I was brought up in a mining background.
p312_088,Either system could have prevented the crash.
p312_089,"Here, the fans have been fantastic."
p312_090,I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p312_091,But these things are happening now.
p312_092,I am very encouraged by this poll.
p312_093,They should be swept away.
p312_094,They thought the set-up there was unfair.
p312_095,It will be a challenging film.
p312_096,The test case is still awaiting action.
p312_097,What happens next?
p312_098,"He added, The old system has reached its limits."
p312_099,We could easily be cut again.
p312_100,The plot is minimal.
p312_101,The scheme is hopelessly failing.
p312_102,They're just a nonsense.
p312_103,There may be some resistance.
p312_104,I could not believe it.
p312_105,One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p312_106,The Rangers think they have problems.
p312_107,He will go a long way.
p312_108,Then there was her childhood.
p312_109,"Hopefully, he will get a lucky break."
p312_110,I thought that all musicians were the same.
p312_111,It's so much more fun.
p312_112,I believe he could have turned it around.
p312_113,"Secondly, there are other options for patients."
p312_114,Where do you think she is going?
p312_115,This looks like it's anything but open.
p312_116,I am not against a further inquiry.
p312_117,Such is the scene of the tragedy.
p312_118,It's a double whammy.
p312_119,What's the theme?
p312_120,We are satisfied that this is the case.
p312_121,"For me, it was a shattering experience."
p312_122,This latter suggestion is very important.
p312_123,The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p312_124,"Davis is very supportive, as a director."
p312_125,There was some merit in that.
p312_126,That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p312_127,What's wrong with that?
p312_128,The pain is still acute.
p312_129,His remit is specific.
p312_130,It is a very big problem.
p312_131,Frustration is not the word.
p312_132,The police have to act to help them.
p312_133,She was extremely rigid.
p312_134,"It may be down, but New York is not out."
p312_135,But what lies ahead?
p312_136,I am so upset.
p312_137,I was blown out of proportion.
p312_138,There was a definite prejudice.
p312_139,It's the same with us.
p312_140,It's an awful lot of money.
p312_141,He was the architect.
p312_142,This should include procedures for personal imports.
p312_143,It's a fantastic achievement.
p312_144,Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
p312_145,"He, too, was not satisfied."
p312_146,It's easy to see why.
p312_147,I've never regretted coming here.
p312_148,"He is in a lot of pain, it's very distressing."
p312_149,"I am so, so, so lucky."
p312_150,"We still have a long, long way to go."
p312_151,I fell into it by accident.
p312_152,I only wanted to give her a fright.
p312_153,Where does it come from?
p312_154,"Norman was not doing so bad, either."
p312_155,"If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment."
p312_156,It is almost certain to be the last.
p312_157,Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p312_158,That says something for his strength of character.
p312_159,The world is being invited to visit.
p312_160,"If it's not, they didn't go far enough."
p312_161,I think it's a sensible change.
p312_162,Sex is fun?
p312_163,I'm not sure.
p312_164,His first album was a hit.
p312_165,He had played well in that central role.
p312_166,And who would argue with that?
p312_167,It was visibly on fire.
p312_168,"What's it for, after all?"
p312_169,"Who would be out there, singing?"
p312_170,A number of people could not speak English.
p312_171,They have got off with murder.
p312_172,Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p312_173,This remains the party's policy.
p312_174,I cannot say anymore.
p312_175,They want this research to continue.
p312_176,Robert is a special talent.
p312_177,They are going to carry it through.
p312_178,"It was very, very dejected."
p312_179,You can't keep them separate.
p312_180,I think it can count against you now.
p312_181,He was a legend.
p312_182,That's when the story first appeared.
p312_183,You're going to die.
p312_184,There was a substantial explosion.
p312_185,He will continue to provide support for them.
p312_186,I'm going to see my friend.
p312_187,We played too deeply.
p312_188,I probably would have been a dancer.
p312_189,There is a lot of heroin about.
p312_190,We're going to see a Government in a hurry.
p312_191,He never asked me for money.
p312_192,I was a bit nervous.
p312_193,There was no question of him not impressing.
p312_194,"However, we came through."
p312_195,I love this tournament.
p312_196,He had a heart problem.
p312_197,I am desperate to play for Scotland.
p312_198,It is a large number.
p312_199,"We felt at the moment, it was not possible."
p312_200,Hear what they have to say.
p312_201,Now there's a thought.
p312_202,I believe that the answer is simple.
p312_203,"That, he claimed, was essential."
p312_204,I was on the pitch and everything.
p312_205,They told him to go to drama school.
p312_206,Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
p312_207,Let us hope so.
p312_208,She looked very settled.
p312_209,Of course he was right!
p312_210,The next few months will tell.
p312_211,It felt like my support system was leaving.
p312_212,But my daughter has got nothing.
p312_213,You can see their point.
p312_214,"Nobody, if he has anything to do with it."
p312_215,The dangers are very obvious.
p312_216,There were no casualties.
p312_217,Is it in the right place?
p312_218,I played well in my time there.
p312_219,"A teacher is, really, about unity."
p312_220,They are still going to be impulsive.
p312_221,I love you so very much.
p312_222,The scheme was simple but extremely effective.
p312_223,He is a very nice man.
p312_224,We want to sort it out.
p312_225,Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p312_226,Such a city does not exist.
p312_227,It made me determined to get back.
p312_228,It was no avail.
p312_229,We're going to see more extreme weather.
p312_230,He was replaced by John Spencer.
p312_231,"Of course, we have to be very concerned about that."
p312_232,That is in the very nature of farming.
p312_233,"And, also, when he does not have the ball."
p312_234,It was worth the wait.
p312_235,I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p312_236,It will take place in July.
p312_237,We must not give in to the bastards.
p312_238,This is a major step forward for carers.
p312_239,I think it was his parents.
p312_240,Our commitment is to move forward.
p312_241,"Partly, it is his own fault."
p312_242,It's a personal matter.
p312_243,That's where it all started.
p312_244,I won't go back.
p312_245,Why has it taken so long?
p312_246,You make the choice.
p312_247,And does it?
p312_248,I was proud of our lads.
p312_249,These will finally be corrected by next week.
p312_250,This kind of traffic is commonplace.
p312_251,All would be under threat.
p312_252,Was it a foul?
p312_253,He leaves a beat.
p312_254,Perhaps it was her demeanour.
p312_255,It lasted longer than we thought.
p312_256,Promises were not kept.
p312_257,"It hasn't happened, but other things have."
p312_258,The claim was denied by first minister.
p312_259,Who is he?
p312_260,It has to be long-term commitment.
p312_261,"It was that bad, that low."
p312_262,That would be a big mistake.
p312_263,His arrival could be the making of them.
p312_264,"After all, this is the start of the giving age."
p312_265,I said How much?
p312_266,You are a liar.
p312_267,The scheme has been funded by the Government.
p312_268,We're still talking about it.
p312_269,She would say he was still the best.
p312_270,He finished the night in a cell.
p312_271,I'm not afraid of that.
p312_272,I don't know what he was shouting.
p312_273,It is the icing on the cake.
p312_274,It was a new ball game.
p312_275,The people here are quite reserved.
p312_276,Previously police had said that schools were safe.
p312_277,Our legal advice is clear.
p312_278,"The past is history, not destiny."
p312_279,These were the edited highlights.
p312_280,All were within range of Israeli cities.
p312_281,They were totally behind it.
p312_282,"However, it is believed they were from the Highlands."
p312_283,We could do a lot worse.
p312_284,Knowledge is everything at this level.
p312_285,Inquiries are ongoing into this incident.
p312_286,It is all one-sided.
p312_287,"In the end, that was enough to beat England."
p312_288,That was the initial attraction.
p312_289,Who will take them after that?
p312_290,He's also thinking long-term.
p312_291,A kinder but effective treatment would be welcomed.
p312_292,Trevor has been great.
p312_293,It would also take time.
p312_294,"Rather than answer, she resigned."
p312_295,"She said No, he's not in Elgin today."
p312_296,I was first in the door.
p312_297,It is highly unlikely.
p312_298,Bill is a mentor.
p312_299,The atmosphere is businesslike.
p312_300,I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
p312_301,There will be no exceptions to this rule.
p312_302,What makes a house a home?
p312_303,Destruction came from within.
p312_304,"I think however, he was having a fit!"
p312_305,It is good to look back.
p312_306,You can't do one without the other.
p312_307,Obviously we want to stop the rot.
p312_308,Chris Paterson was outstanding.
p312_309,The casting of her husband was an accident.
p312_310,I would say so.
p312_311,"It's not the end of the matter, of course."
p312_312,"Sub Not Used, McKay."
p312_313,And they did just that.
p312_314,You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p312_315,She has left the island.
p312_316,They had three children.
p312_317,Our system is archaic.
p312_318,She had kept the news from him.
p312_319,We want to know about the policy.
p312_320,It is not illegal.
p312_321,I wouldn't say this is normal.
p312_322,We don't have the credible evidence.
p312_323,That will be the case on Tuesday.
p312_324,It's one up to the Scots.
p312_325,This is complete nonsense.
p312_326,I don't want to use the term.
p312_327,There is still hope.
p312_328,It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
p312_329,It's all happening at a local level.
p312_330,She is a great talent.
p312_331,It's the big omission.
p312_332,We do things in an appropriate way.
p312_334,"However, she is female, and so."
p312_335,The playing is perfectly turned out.
p312_336,He will be advised by me.
p312_337,But he did not rule out further talks.
p312_338,It's part of your life.
p312_339,He had a horror.
p312_340,We're delighted and we certainly deserved it.
p312_341,This time we may not be seeking volunteers.
p312_342,That was the biggest game of my life.
p312_343,This is perfectly legal.
p312_344,That's the most important thing for me.
p312_345,Then came the second round.
p312_346,"Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so."
p312_347,Saddam is not threatening this country.
p312_348,We told them in June.
p312_349,Parents should avoid it.
p312_350,"It was not a difficult decision, he said."
p312_351,It was a horrible thing to happen.
p312_352,And she's not even in the book!
p312_353,Of course it's a bunch of trouble.
p312_354,I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
p312_355,"He, too, is killing."
p312_356,Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
p312_357,It's better to be happy.
p312_358,It's just so sad.
p312_359,"We have lost the round, but not the fight."
p312_360,And Scotland is no different.
p312_361,It's been an extremely frustrating year for me.
p312_362,We are in a learning curve.
p312_363,He can do everything.
p312_364,She was just that sort of person.
p312_365,Is it a warning to parents?
p312_366,You've gotten all the facts.
p312_367,And it will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p312_368,Soon the whole country will be level.
p312_369,"And huge, indeed, it is."
p312_370,I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p312_371,Attack appears to be the biggest concern.
p312_372,"For his opposite number, this was a just triumph."
p312_373,He said he needed no more evidence.
p312_374,It's such a tragedy.
p312_375,It was a long time coming.
p312_376,Gordon Brown was superb.
p312_377,The referee didn't do his job.
p312_378,We are very nearly there.
p312_379,Stand by for action.
p312_380,Barry will be able to handle this.
p312_381,"However, this suggestion was turned down by the player."
p312_382,The urgency is real.
p312_383,They have been for some time now.
p312_384,It was only logical to end it.
p312_385,"Yet the consensus is, it's worth it."
p312_386,I've no passion for any country.
p312_387,"Scotland needs to hear it, too."
p312_388,Nobody ever gets to see them.
p312_389,That's an old idea.
p312_390,It is part and parcel of it.
p312_391,The only safe investment is cash.
p312_392,It's the whole season.
p312_393,We had no choice but to go down.
p312_394,We are keen to have him back.
p312_395,This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p312_396,"Of course, it was very passionate in Glasgow."
p312_397,And we all understand that.
p312_398,The new incitement offence will cover all religions.
p312_399,"Clearly, the future remains uncertain."
p312_400,Do what you have to do.
p312_401,We must do well in that.
p312_402,She died later on Monday.
p312_403,No-one has yet been charged.
p312_404,"If so, they were wrong."
p312_405,This is my big break.
p312_406,It was meant to rival the dollar.
p312_407,There is no easy answer.
p312_408,There was someone on the floor.
p312_409,I put pressure on him.
p312_410,He supported the decision to review the decision.
p312_411,It was chaotic and frightening.
p312_412,Friday night was a pretty good night.
p312_413,He will never walk the streets again.
p312_414,The proposals have been taken out of context.
p312_415,Golf has lost a great character.
p312_416,"However, it has had only a limited uptake."
p312_417,"I have to say, for me, the game was not."
p312_418,"However, the report was incorrect."
p312_419,There was no pressure at all.
