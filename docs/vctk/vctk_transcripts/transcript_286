p286_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p286_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p286_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p286_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p286_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p286_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p286_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p286_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p286_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p286_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p286_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p286_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p286_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p286_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p286_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p286_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p286_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p286_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p286_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p286_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p286_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p286_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p286_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p286_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p286_025,"Smoking is also very important.
"
p286_026,"We must convince the citizens.
"
p286_027,"I am pretty careful with money.
"

"
p286_033,"I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
"
p286_034,"Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
"
p286_035,"Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
"
p286_036,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p286_037,"Costs have got to be controlled.
"
p286_038,"You must always attempt to raise the bar.
"
p286_039,"The staff are as good as any staff in the city.

p286_055,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p286_056,"People come to see the Highlands.
"
p286_057,"The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
"
p286_058,"We have not given up hope.
"
p286_059,"The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
"
p286_060,"We would have concerns about suspension.

"
p286_093,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p286_094,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p286_095,"And does it ?

p286_114,"Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
"
p286_115,"We should recognise that others have done a good job.
"
p286_116,"In the end we made too many errors.
"
p286_117,"But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
"
p286_118,"We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
"
p286_119,"Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
"
p286_120,"The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
"
p286_121,"It is an impressive record.

p286_122,"I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
"
p286_123,"I have learned from him.
"
p286_124,"I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.

"
p286_133,"Structural changes were also required.
"
p286_134,"It was a good game to watch.
"
p286_135,"His job was not advertised.
"
p286_136,"However, the problem is the timing.
"
p286_137,"They keep the atmosphere in mind.
"
p286_138,"Which can happen any time.
"
p286_139,"It is the latter which has prompted the warning.

p286_143,"The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
"
p286_144,"The first half was depressing.
"
p286_145,"Tiger is not the norm.
"
p286_146,"He will get his chances.
"
p286_147,"They could use a boost.
"
p286_148,"What happened in that game ?
"
p286_149,"Are you going to win ?
"
p286_150,"Was it the wife ?

"
p286_179,"The second aspect was the fear of failure.
"
p286_180,"First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
"
p286_181,"People should not become complacent.
"
p286_182,"This championship is different from the other majors.

"
p286_184,"I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
"
p286_185,"At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
"

"
p286_202,"It caused a lot of upset.
"
p286_203,"Does the name matter ?
"
p286_204,"how do you get it back ?
"
p286_205,"What are you not good at ?
"

p286_211,"Mr Blair was ready for him.
"
p286_212,"Because he was born in England.
"
p286_213,"We've had an enjoyable adventure.
"
p286_214,"It comes from reflection or thinking.
