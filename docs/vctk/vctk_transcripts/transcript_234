p234_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p234_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p234_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p234_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p234_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p234_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p234_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p234_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p234_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p234_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p234_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p234_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p234_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p234_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p234_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p234_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p234_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p234_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p234_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p234_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p234_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p234_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p234_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p234_025,"We are a service industry.
"
p234_026,"But we will have to wait.
"
p234_027,"Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
"
p234_028,"I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
"
p234_029,"However, the following year the cancer returned.
"
p234_030,"On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
"
p234_031,"It is on the internet.
"
p234_032,"Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
"
p234_033,"This is a central issue.
"
p234_034,"It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
"
p234_035,"History is in the making.
"
p234_036,"It was sold at a loss.
"
p234_037,"However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
"
p234_038,"Victory was never in doubt.
"
p234_039,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p234_040,"We are the party of the future.
"
p234_041,"I have never been a member of the council.
"
p234_042,"He was in his element.
"
p234_043,"That means an extra two years.
"
p234_044,"At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
"
p234_045,"All businesses continue to trade.
"
p234_046,"The man became a reporter.
"
p234_047,"It depends on the decisions of the member states.
"
p234_048,"It is all starting to come together.
"
p234_049,"Part of the complex is historic.
"
p234_050,"The strategy is not without risk.
"
p234_051,"But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
"
p234_052,"I was released after six days.
"
p234_053,"Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
"
p234_054,"We are working on it.
"
p234_055,"I've never been one for complaining about the press.
"
p234_056,"This trend is likely to strengthen.
"
p234_057,"Still, he did not let himself down this week.
"
p234_058,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p234_059,"There was no safety net.
"
p234_060,"He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
"
p234_061,"You have to be patient.
"
p234_062,"That is all in the past.
"
p234_063,"That could be a mistake.
"
p234_064,"It was an amazing result.
"
p234_065,"Indeed, it is only the beginning.
"
p234_066,"He has not been dropped.
"
p234_067,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p234_068,"Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
"
p234_069,"The market is appalling for initial public offerings.
"
p234_070,"This time, it might be for real.
"
p234_071,"She did that for the rest of her life.
"
p234_072,"Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
"
p234_073,"It starts with the script.
"
p234_074,"We were under a bit of pressure.
"
p234_075,"The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
"
p234_076,"We can all make a mistake.
"
p234_077,"Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
"
p234_079,"However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
"
p234_080,"On the night, it was not enough.
"
p234_081,"It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
"
p234_082,"However, a ruling will not come before next week.
"
p234_083,"They were badly prepared for it.
"
p234_084,"It is not a story.
"
p234_085,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p234_086,"How are you, sir ?
"
p234_087,"So is that it, then ?
"
p234_088,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p234_089,"What do we do ?
"
p234_090,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p234_091,"However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
"
p234_092,"They have a further report to make in March.
"
p234_093,"He is in the US.
"
p234_094,"The Festival is prepared to help.
"
p234_095,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p234_096,"I had a bit in hand.
"
p234_097,"We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
"
p234_098,"I cannot wait to get started on it.
"
p234_099,"That is the fact of the matter.
"
p234_100,"It should be a condition of employment.
"
p234_101,"I had no intention of misleading anyone.
"
p234_102,"It is much as it has been described.
"
p234_103,"Police said the family was helping with the search.
"
p234_104,"She was there for the start of the campaign.
"
p234_105,"He has become a monster.
"
p234_106,"In fact, he should never have been in the field.
"
p234_107,"Everyone had to play the game.
"
p234_108,"In London today, it was business as usual.
"
p234_109,"It is not affected by the sale.
"
p234_110,"We are currently working on the details.
"
p234_111,"That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.
"
p234_112,"That would be a serious problem.
"
p234_113,"Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.
"
p234_114,"People have been placed in a state of alarm.
"
p234_115,"She is not a victim.
"
p234_116,"A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
"
p234_117,"And we had a good response.
"
p234_118,"When we looked at the company.
"
p234_119,"No, the equipment is extra.
"
p234_120,"For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
"
p234_121,"The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
"
p234_122,"That admission is not surprising.
"
p234_123,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p234_124,"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
"
p234_125,"There was a lot of resentment.
"
p234_126,"He wanted to record the group.
"
p234_127,"However, it was a different story in the final.
"
p234_128,"The end result is the same.
"
p234_129,"Three days later, he was killed.
"
p234_130,"We are committed to the ban.
"
p234_131,"However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
"
p234_132,"The problem was a social problem.
"
p234_133,"He had no money left to run the club.
"
p234_134,"It is not so simple.
"
p234_135,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p234_136,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p234_137,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p234_138,"And does it ?
"
p234_139,"Are you from the rugby ?
"
p234_140,"Actors like to be in the centre.
"
p234_141,"When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
"
p234_142,"They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
"
p234_143,"Here, again, they were denied a voice.
"
p234_144,"Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
"
p234_145,"I can't even get into the A team.
"
p234_146,"In addition, investor choice is reduced.
"
p234_147,"She does not want to speak.
"
p234_148,"It is expected to last a week.
"
p234_149,"Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
"
p234_150,"It is too pretty, it is too small.
"
p234_151,"As for the warning, it was not needed.
"
p234_152,"But it is different in different regions.
"
p234_153,"That is the nature of the game.
"
p234_154,"There is a spring in the step.
"
p234_155,"We want to get there.
"
p234_156,"He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
"
p234_157,"I have a lot of confidence in this team.
"
p234_158,"The players were under pressure.
"
p234_159,"Not that the occasion was without restraint.
"
p234_160,"There is no common ground.
"
p234_161,"In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
"
p234_162,"In that case, the children were not missing.
"
p234_163,"Frankly, it was worth the booking.
"
p234_164,"Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
"
p234_165,"Anyone can do the sums.
"
p234_166,"At the moment we do not understand it.
"
p234_167,"So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
"
p234_168,"It is not about the money, it is about everything.
"
p234_169,"Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
"
p234_170,"Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
"
p234_171,"Much of the equipment was new.
"
p234_172,"I have had a good life.
"
p234_173,"Three hours later, the man was free.
"
p234_174,"That was the difference between the sides.
"
p234_175,"They have not been named.
"
p234_176,"I was in a hole.
"
p234_177,"It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
"
p234_178,"I was always in control.
"
p234_179,"I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
"
p234_180,"For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
"
p234_181,"He was asked to quit.
"
p234_182,"There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
"
p234_183,"Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
"
p234_184,"They were not seeking the right to strike.
"
p234_185,"He called for a public inquiry.
"
p234_186,"Tony Blair has had a good conference.
"
p234_187,"As, indeed, they would be.
"
p234_188,"By then, however, both men were already in the US.
"
p234_189,"It is simply not true.
"
p234_190,"In light of things, I think I made the right decision.
"
p234_191,"It is not in the public interest.
"
p234_192,"Well, this article is a bit like that.
"
p234_193,"The performance is not there.
"
p234_194,"It would make a lot of sense.
"
p234_195,"At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
"
p234_196,"Clearly, they had other problems.
"
p234_197,"He has defended the system.
"
p234_198,"If that's the case, he will struggle.
"
p234_199,"I could not sit in the stands.
"
p234_200,"At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
"
p234_201,"They have to get that sorted.
"
p234_202,"Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
"
p234_203,"We can take the city.
"
p234_204,"Are you going to win ?
"
p234_205,"Was it the wife ?
"
p234_207,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p234_208,"Does the name matter ?
"
p234_209,"I will be in Scotland.
"
p234_210,"It was the story of the second half.
"
p234_211,"The trading conditions are not good.
"
p234_212,"It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
"
p234_213,"Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
"
p234_214,"This is an interesting link.
"
p234_216,"It was a management problem in the hospital.
"
p234_217,"Being investor ready is a good start.
"
p234_218,"Last night, the company could not be contacted.
"
p234_219,"I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
"
p234_220,"This conference was never confirmed.
"
p234_221,"However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
"
p234_222,"We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
"
p234_223,"He must have a crack at it.
"
p234_224,"The force is with them.
"
p234_225,"Her experience is certainly limited.
"
p234_226,"The deal is expected to be completed by September.
"
p234_227,"However, he said the money had not been wasted.
"
p234_228,"Mr Blair was ready for him.
"
p234_229,"We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.
"
p234_230,"He intends to restart in the spring.
"
p234_231,"He is a good friend.
"
p234_232,"It is the strength of the school.
"
p234_233,"But it may not be all bad news.
"
p234_234,"It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
"
p234_235,"The conference is the first test.
"
p234_236,"Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
"
p234_237,"But we are not immune to the problem.
"
p234_238,"I was not overly concerned about this.
"
p234_239,"However, it is not as simple as this.
"
p234_240,"On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
"
p234_241,"A deadline is still essential.
"
p234_242,"And they were being paid ?
"
p234_243,"Was everything done to save people ?
"
p234_244,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p234_245,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p234_246,"Is it in the right place ?
"
p234_247,"Did he trip ?
"
p234_248,"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
"
p234_249,"You can buy them over the counter, anywhere.
"
p234_250,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p234_251,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p234_252,"It was far from business as usual.
"
p234_253,"It was just another play.
"
p234_254,"From there, they can go anywhere.
"
p234_255,"The world is a good place.
"
p234_256,"This is a sensible and common sense approach.
"
p234_257,"The matter is under appeal.
"
p234_258,"I am delighted for them.
"
p234_259,"It was a great experience.
"
p234_260,"They are difficult awards to decide.
"
p234_261,"Anyway, the job will be part-time.
"
p234_262,"His second was a beauty.
"
p234_263,"However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
"
p234_264,"Scotland played a major part in the project.
"
p234_265,"Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
"
p234_266,"Not in this production he doesn't.
"
p234_267,"We can certainly build on this.
"
p234_268,"Then was the summer of their discontent.
"
p234_269,"There is a world of difference.
"
p234_270,"This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
"
p234_271,"Well, it was certainly different.
"
p234_272,"We want this place to work.
"
p234_273,"Clearly, the stakes are high.
"
p234_274,"So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
"
p234_275,"The statement contained no surprises.
"
p234_276,"The performance continues to improve.
"
p234_277,"That would be a danger.
"
p234_278,"Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
"
p234_279,"However, no further action was taken by police.
"
p234_280,"It depends on Labour, not on us.
"
p234_281,"I had to be into it.
"
p234_282,"My view has always been the same.
"
p234_283,"In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
"
p234_284,"It is set in Paris.
"
p234_285,"Do you think we're a top nation ?
"
p234_286,"Is our children learning ?
"
p234_287,"How independent is that ?
"
p234_288,"What form did that take ?
"
p234_289,"Are they free ?
"
p234_290,"The party has never fully recovered.
"
p234_291,"In many ways, that is as important.
"
p234_292,"His leader wanted to celebrate.
"
p234_293,"It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
"
p234_294,"Of further privacy, he had no need.
"
p234_295,"He was good, but not that good.
"
p234_296,"The results are expected within days.
"
p234_297,"The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
"
p234_298,"Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
"
p234_299,"We were well worth the win.
"
p234_300,"And it was this one.
"
p234_301,"But that's another story for another day.
"
p234_302,"But it was also hard.
"
p234_303,"If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
"
p234_304,"We're looking for unity in the council.
"
p234_305,"By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
"
p234_306,"They are not going the length of the pitch.
"
p234_307,"However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
"
p234_308,"The concerns are the same.
"
p234_309,"That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
"
p234_310,"Scotland won by six wickets.
"
p234_311,"It has to be enforced.
"
p234_312,"And we can do it.
"
p234_313,"Every one is a winner.
"
p234_314,"Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
"
p234_315,"They have set the standard.
"
p234_316,"This is a major property in Edinburgh.
"
p234_317,"It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
"
p234_318,"The existing structure is in trouble.
"
p234_319,"It all started with a visiting rugby club.
"
p234_320,"He refused to reveal the reasons for the split.
"
p234_321,"You have to count on other people.
"
p234_322,"Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
"
p234_323,"And he's the real thing.
"
p234_324,"What are they for ?
"
p234_325,"Is there a waiting list ?
"
p234_326,"Do they think anyone else wants them ?
"
p234_327,"But it is important for a number of reasons.
"
p234_328,"All of the management has invested in the firm.
"
p234_329,"The family is not interested in the value of the house.
"
p234_330,"It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
"
p234_331,"Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
"
p234_332,"But it can be done.
"
p234_333,"Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
"
p234_334,"We have to be very, very careful.
"
p234_335,"In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
"
p234_336,"This could be a mistake.
"
p234_337,"Hopefully, this week will be good.
"
p234_338,"Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
"
p234_339,"I think the overall picture is still strong.
"
p234_340,"That is always a problem.
"
p234_341,"We will deliver at director level.
"
p234_342,"We did something about it.
"
p234_343,"The market is the market.
"
p234_344,"We do not have the papers.
"
p234_345,"However, the devil is in the detail.
"
p234_346,"For the moment, however, the position is clear.
"
p234_347,"The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
"
p234_348,"The answer was in space.
"
p234_349,"We are not interested in dividends.
"
p234_350,"Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
"
p234_351,"His concern is only for the future.
"
p234_352,"And it's a goodbye from him.
"
p234_353,"They have to be addressed.
"
