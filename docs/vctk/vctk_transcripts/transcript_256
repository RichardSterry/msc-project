p256_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p256_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p256_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p256_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p256_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p256_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p256_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p256_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p256_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p256_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p256_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p256_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p256_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p256_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p256_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p256_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p256_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p256_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p256_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p256_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p256_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p256_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p256_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p256_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p256_025,"It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
"
p256_026,"We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
"
p256_027,"I have a theory.
"
p256_028,"Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
"
p256_029,"There's a story, too.
"
p256_030,"I was an athlete.
"
p256_031,"Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
"
p256_032,"They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
"
p256_033,"Then, suddenly, they weren't.
"
p256_034,"A web site is planned for November.
"
p256_035,"It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
"
p256_036,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p256_037,"At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
"
p256_038,"They're just different.
"
p256_039,"It's a real threat.
"
p256_040,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p256_041,"It had been played at festivals.
"
p256_042,"Indeed, he does.
"
p256_043,"She is believed to be in South Africa.
"
p256_044,"This film will be totally awesome.
"
p256_045,"No meaningful response was issued.
"
p256_046,"That period was a struggle.
"
p256_047,"A neighbour said.
"
p256_048,"It's a crucial award.
"
p256_049,"It is difficult for Ali.
"
p256_050,"It's a blessing.
"
p256_051,"Is a drug dealer?
"
p256_052,"It has been a horrible, horrible time.
"
p256_053,"I would love to have him home.
"
p256_054,"No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
"
p256_055,"He had no enemies.
"
p256_056,"Sadly, it can't.
"
p256_057,"There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
"
p256_058,"It is unique.
"
p256_059,"It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
"
p256_060,"That's the truth.
"
p256_061,"That is very hard, alone.
"
p256_062,"In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
"
p256_063,"The problems are a result of that shortfall.
"
p256_064,"And a film maker was born.
"
p256_065,"It's a matter of balance.
"
p256_066,"The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
"
p256_067,"George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
"
p256_068,"They may yet have the last laugh.
"
p256_069,"There was a battle there.
"
p256_070,"They are real.
"
p256_071,"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
"
p256_072,"I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
"
p256_073,"It should be devolved.
"
p256_074,"Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
"
p256_075,"I was as strong as a horse.
"
p256_076,"Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
"
p256_077,"The girls are so lucky to be alive.
"
p256_078,"IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
"
p256_079,"The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
"
p256_080,"It is a terrible place.
"
p256_081,"I've got the shirt.
"
p256_082,"This is the way things should be handled.
"
p256_083,"It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
"
p256_084,"It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
"
p256_085,"It may well have been.
"
p256_086,"I first met him last summer.
"
p256_087,"Last week, he was taken into hospital.
"
p256_088,"He seems to be pleased with the picture.
"
p256_089,"It's never too late.
"
p256_090,"It was nice.
"
p256_091,"We do not get that impression now.
"
p256_092,"The city council is a major property owner in the area.
"
p256_093,"That will come after the game on Saturday.
"
p256_094,"A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
"
p256_095,"We must look forward.
"
p256_096,"I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
"
p256_097,"They've got to account for it.
"
p256_098,"She told The Herald.
"
p256_099,"It was clear.
"
p256_100,"There was no rescue.
"
p256_101,"We could not get any possession.
"
p256_102,"They are now divorced.
"
p256_103,"The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
"
p256_104,"Journalists should make him.
"
p256_105,"A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
"
p256_106,"Get to know him.
"
p256_107,"But it was a pleasure.
"
p256_108,"We have every respect for Michelle.
"
p256_109,"But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
"
p256_110,"I didn't play well last year.
"
p256_111,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p256_112,"They will want to perform well.
"
p256_113,"It's not perfect.
"
p256_114,"It was the eighties.
"
p256_115,"They were behind the wheel.
"
p256_116,"This is a step backwards.
"
p256_117,"It was ugly.
"
p256_118,"It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
"
p256_119,"I joined a group.
"
p256_120,"It is rubbish.
"
p256_121,"Who would be a referee?
"
p256_122,"That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
"
p256_123,"There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
"
p256_124,"The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
"
p256_125,"We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
"
p256_126,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p256_127,"Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
"
p256_128,"Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
"
p256_129,"His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
"
p256_130,"They keep the atmosphere in mind.
"
p256_131,"Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
"
p256_132,"Well, you can have a tree.
"
p256_133,"Who will attend?
"
p256_134,"Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
"
p256_135,"The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
"
p256_136,"Our intentions are real.
"
p256_137,"It is also well received.
"
p256_138,"We never said that we would walk through the third division.
"
p256_139,"Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
"
p256_140,"It was very frightened and dirty.
"
p256_141,"We want to keep the pound.
"
p256_142,"And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
"
p256_143,"The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
"
p256_144,"It changed my life.
"
p256_145,"Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
"
p256_146,"It is not just about pay.
"
p256_147,"The home side didn't stand a chance.
"
p256_148,"I was so nervous.
"
p256_149,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p256_150,"They have not been named.
"
p256_151,"There's a sense of excess in the novel.
"
p256_152,"We should be clear about the role of government.
"
p256_153,"It was by the numbers.
"
p256_154,"She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
"
p256_155,"We will turn the corner.
"
p256_156,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p256_157,"He can do no wrong.
"
p256_158,"Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
"
p256_159,"These days are long gone.
"
p256_160,"I will tell you.
"
p256_161,"A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
"
p256_162,"It has to be now.
"
p256_163,"We have to move forward.
"
p256_164,"They are not advertised.
"
p256_165,"We knew we had the goal we wanted.
"
p256_166,"It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
"
p256_167,"By then, however, both men were already in the US.
"
p256_168,"Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
"
p256_169,"The post will be unpaid.
"
p256_170,"Does that put pressure on us?
"
p256_171,"Waiting times for these services are too long.
"
p256_172,"It is too much for me.
"
p256_173,"We've made a couple of albums.
"
p256_174,"It is not either national standards or local control.
"
p256_175,"If that's the case, he will struggle.
"
p256_176,"The hotel was now for sale.
"
p256_177,"The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
"
p256_178,"They took a risk.
"
p256_179,"I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
"
p256_180,"There is no point in looking any further.
"
p256_181,"Nothing is safe.
"
p256_182,"They will run a mile.
"
p256_183,"Four policemen were wounded.
"
p256_184,"They receive a high profile in the media.
"
p256_185,"We did everything by the book.
"
p256_186,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p256_187,"I saw military vehicles in the distance.
"
p256_188,"My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
"
p256_189,"It is a terrible loss.
"
p256_190,"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
"
p256_191,"If the director is with you.
"
p256_192,"I am totally surprised.
"
p256_193,"I grew up listening to these people.
"
p256_194,"The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
"
p256_195,"Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
"
p256_196,"It is a case of taking a risk.
"
p256_197,"I wanted to put myself on the line.
"
p256_198,"It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
"
p256_199,"People acted too quickly.
"
p256_200,"I have a cold.
"
p256_201,"The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
"
p256_202,"Tommy is not a problem.
"
p256_203,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p256_204,"They've got three-quarters of the way.
"
p256_205,"But she might be.
"
p256_206,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p256_207,"After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
"
p256_208,"It's like a garage.
"
p256_209,"But I am a worried man.
"
p256_210,"HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
"
p256_211,"She should not be blamed.
"
p256_212,"It had all been arranged.
"
p256_213,"The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
"
p256_214,"The FBI could become involved.
"
p256_215,"A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
"
p256_216,"The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
"
p256_217,"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
"
p256_218,"The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
"
p256_219,"We've got the bronze.
"
p256_220,"It's so special.
"
p256_221,"We will be victorious.
"
p256_222,"He seemed to lose his focus.
"
p256_223,"At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
"
p256_224,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p256_225,"I am immensely sad.
"
p256_226,"It is a gamble.
"
p256_227,"My neighbours are horrified.
"
p256_228,"The track is currently covered in snow.
"
p256_229,"I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
"
p256_230,"They are the innocent victims.
"
p256_231,"My wife and family are the support system.
"
p256_232,"The body follows the mind.
"
p256_233,"It is set in Paris.
"
p256_234,"It's quite nice.
"
p256_235,"It's a lovely, lovely film.
"
p256_236,"A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
"
p256_237,"However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
"
p256_238,"The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
"
p256_239,"He was good, but not that good.
"
p256_240,"He claimed the government had lost the plot.
"
p256_241,"Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
"
p256_242,"It would appear that it has not been a problem.
"
p256_243,"It is hard won.
"
p256_244,"He says that he is no different from any other man.
"
p256_245,"The scene is about this?
"
p256_246,"Some families have even requested to leave the city.
"
p256_247,"We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
"
p256_248,"In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
"
p256_249,"I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
"
p256_250,"It was a hit.
"
p256_251,"There will be widespread support on all sides.
"
p256_252,"Her presence was almost everywhere.
"
p256_253,"I was never going to play against Scotland.
"
p256_254,"At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
"
p256_255,"That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
"
p256_256,"The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
"
p256_257,"Chelsea was a great club.
"
p256_258,"That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
"
p256_259,"One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
"
p256_260,"It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
"
p256_261,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p256_262,"I am very angry.
"
p256_263,"The pensioners did not want to know.
"
p256_264,"I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
"
p256_265,"He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
"
p256_266,"Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
"
p256_267,"That's the only thing I will say.
"
p256_268,"It looks as though he will be right.
"
p256_269,"Of course, that is not the whole story.
"
p256_270,"He has not created a Festival resource.
"
p256_271,"Frankly, we should all have such problems.
"
p256_272,"It was an easy decision to come here.
"
p256_273,"And Michael was just great.
"
p256_274,"She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
"
p256_275,"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
"
p256_276,"I am an estate agent.
"
p256_277,"They were on holiday in Egypt.
"
p256_278,"In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
"
p256_279,"It happens from time to time.
"
p256_280,"For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
"
p256_281,"But I've won both ways.
"
p256_282,"I saw it at a ruck.
"
p256_283,"The attacker died in the crash.
"
p256_284,"The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
"
p256_285,"It's like a high school play.
"
p256_286,"Scotland were beaten again.
"
p256_287,"It's very safe.
"
p256_288,"He was obviously very genuine.
"
p256_289,"She said she could not believe that they had run away.
"
p256_290,"It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
"
p256_291,"He wrote the letter two days before he died.
"
p256_292,"The results are sometimes contentious.
"
p256_293,"The songs are just so good.
"
p256_294,"Who can predict?
"
p256_295,"They are a total disgrace to the loyalist cause.
"
p256_296,"It became a book by itself.
"
p256_297,"The home was now under new management.
"
p256_298,"I thought it was my only chance.
"
p256_300,"One was a lawyer.
"
p256_301,"Our task is to complete the picture.
"
p256_302,"The party lasted all night.
"
p256_303,"It's so awful.
"
p256_304,"It's just not funny!
"
p256_305,"It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
"
p256_306,"Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
"
p256_307,"It is no surprise.
"
p256_308,"Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
"
p256_309,"O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
"
p256_310,"We have waited a long time for this.
"
p256_311,"This is the culture change in medicine.
"
p256_312,"and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
"
p256_313,"This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
"
p256_314,"It is all credit to them today.
"
p256_315,"They were fantastic.
"
p256_316,"There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
"
p256_317,"She is very distinctive.
"
p256_318,"It's not even finished.
"
p256_319,"Henman has been warned.
"
p256_320,"It should be equal.
"
