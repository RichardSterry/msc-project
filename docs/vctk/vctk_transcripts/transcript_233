p233_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p233_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p233_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p233_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p233_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p233_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p233_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p233_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p233_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p233_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p233_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p233_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p233_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p233_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p233_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p233_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p233_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p233_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p233_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p233_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p233_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p233_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p233_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p233_025,"We are a service industry.
"
p233_026,"But we will have to wait.
"
p233_027,"Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
"
p233_028,"I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
"
p233_029,"However, the following year the cancer returned.
"
p233_030,"On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
"
p233_032,"Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
"
p233_033,"This is a central issue.
"
p233_037,"However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
"
p233_038,"Victory was never in doubt.
"
p233_039,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p233_040,"We are the party of the future.
"
p233_041,"I have never been a member of the council.
"
p233_042,"He was in his element.
"
p233_043,"That means an extra two years.
"
p233_044,"At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
"
p233_045,"All businesses continue to trade.
"
p233_046,"The man became a reporter.
"
p233_047,"It depends on the decisions of the member states.
"
p233_048,"It is all starting to come together.
"
p233_049,"Part of the complex is historic.
"
p233_050,"The strategy is not without risk.
"
p233_051,"But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
"
p233_052,"I was released after six days.
"
p233_053,"Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
"
p233_054,"We are working on it.
"
p233_055,"I've never been one for complaining about the press.
"
p233_056,"This trend is likely to strengthen.
"
p233_057,"Still, he did not let himself down this week.
"
p233_058,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p233_059,"There was no safety net.
"
p233_060,"He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
"
p233_061,"You have to be patient.
"
p233_062,"That is all in the past.
"
p233_063,"That could be a mistake.
"
p233_064,"It was an amazing result.
"
p233_065,"Indeed, it is only the beginning.
"
p233_066,"He has not been dropped.
"
p233_067,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p233_068,"Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
"
p233_070,"This time, it might be for real.
"
p233_071,"She did that for the rest of her life.
"
p233_072,"Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
"
p233_073,"It starts with the script.
"
p233_074,"We were under a bit of pressure.
"
p233_075,"The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
"
p233_076,"We can all make a mistake.
"
p233_077,"Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
"
p233_079,"However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
"
p233_080,"On the night, it was not enough.
"
p233_081,"It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
"
p233_082,"However, a ruling will not come before next week.
"
p233_083,"They were badly prepared for it.
"
p233_084,"It is not a story.
"
p233_085,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p233_086,"How are you, sir ?
"
p233_087,"So is that it, then ?
"
p233_088,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p233_089,"What do we do ?
"
p233_090,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p233_091,"However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
"
p233_092,"They have a further report to make in March.
"
p233_093,"He is in the US.
"
p233_094,"The Festival is prepared to help.
"
p233_095,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p233_096,"I had a bit in hand.
"
p233_097,"We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
"
p233_098,"I cannot wait to get started on it.
"
p233_099,"That is the fact of the matter.
"
p233_100,"It should be a condition of employment.
"
p233_101,"I had no intention of misleading anyone.
"
p233_102,"It is much as it has been described.
"
p233_103,"Police said the family was helping with the search.
"
p233_104,"She was there for the start of the campaign.
"
p233_105,"He has become a monster.
"
p233_106,"In fact, he should never have been in the field.
"
p233_107,"Everyone had to play the game.
"
p233_108,"In London today, it was business as usual.
"
p233_109,"It is not affected by the sale.
"
p233_110,"We are currently working on the details.
"
p233_111,"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
"
p233_112,"I thought it was a fantastic game.
"
p233_113,"The picture is the same across Scotland.
"
p233_114,"It was the eighties.
"
p233_115,"We do not expect any surplus.
"
p233_116,"You had better believe it.
"
p233_117,"Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
"
p233_118,"It's not a new concept in jazz.
"
p233_119,"My office is bare.
"
p233_120,"I'm delighted about that.
"
p233_121,"I joined a group.
"
p233_122,"They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
"
p233_123,"Who would be a referee?
"
p233_125,"That's all right then.
"
p233_126,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p233_127,"It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
"
p233_128,"It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
"
p233_129,"His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
"
p233_130,"Next season for every manager is a long time away.
"
p233_131,"It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
"
p233_132,"He's been the key to everything.
"
p233_133,"It's an amazing landscape!
"
p233_134,"Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
"
p233_135,"Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
"
p233_136,"The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
"
p233_137,"I am now unemployed.
"
p233_138,"Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
"
p233_139,"Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
"
p233_140,"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
"
p233_141,"Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg.
"
p233_142,"It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
"
p233_143,"Is that it ?
"
p233_144,"I saw some terrible things.
"
p233_146,"It seems so long since I did the exams.
"
p233_147,"We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
"
p233_148,"Who would be right ?
"
p233_149,"She died at her home.
"
p233_150,"He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
"
p233_151,"That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
"
p233_152,"It is like a football team.
"
p233_153,"It would be a last resort.
"
p233_154,"Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
"
p233_155,"He will emerge as a world leader.
"
p233_156,"It opens the door to the Champions League.
"
p233_157,"The home side didn't stand a chance.
"
p233_158,"The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
"
p233_159,"But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
"
p233_160,"I was so nervous.
"
p233_161,"Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
"
p233_162,"It was deployed in the Gulf War.
"
p233_163,"It is not normal practice.
"
p233_164,"We also enjoyed a lot of support.
"
p233_165,"The attacker has been put in foster care.
"
p233_166,"She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
"
p233_167,"Neither side can win this war.
"
p233_168,"Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
"
p233_169,"It is so unfair.
"
p233_170,"I will tell you.
"
p233_171,"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
"
p233_172,"They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
"
p233_173,"I have got a wife to feed.
"
p233_174,"It's that sort of night.
"
p233_175,"Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
"
p233_176,"Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
"
p233_177,"The release attracted little attention.
"
p233_178,"Waiting times for these services are too long.
"
p233_179,"And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
"
p233_180,"We've made a couple of albums.
"
p233_181,"They thought they had found a home.
"
p233_182,"He will feel the pain again.
"
p233_183,"I always felt they played for me.
"
p233_184,"Is Saddam a threat ?
"
p233_185,"I feel like my game has come a long way.
"
p233_186,"The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
"
p233_187,"If that's the case, he will struggle.
"
p233_188,"There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
"
p233_189,"We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
"
p233_190,"I was totally wrong.
"
p233_191,"There is no point in looking any further.
"
p233_192,"I've been there.
"
p233_193,"It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
"
p233_194,"It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
"
p233_195,"It's a joke.
"
p233_196,"I had a train to catch.
"
p233_197,"It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
"
p233_198,"We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
"
p233_199,"However, this idea is never developed.
"
p233_200,"It's very difficult to find a buyer.
"
p233_201,"He may need it.
"
p233_203,"It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
"
p233_204,"It wasn't to be.
"
p233_208,"It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
"
p233_209,"I have a cold.
"
p233_210,"He had suffered a heart attack.
"
p233_211,"A deadline is still essential.
"
p233_212,"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
"
p233_213,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p233_214,"That will be vital.
"
p233_215,"We need to handle it.
"
p233_216,"The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
"
p233_217,"I had relied on him.
"
p233_218,"His third goal was superb.
"
p233_220,"In each case they were a goal down.
"
p233_221,"The FBI could become involved.
"
p233_222,"Work has started.
"
p233_223,"The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
"
p233_224,"He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
"
p233_225,"The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
"
p233_226,"Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
"
p233_228,"Mental health is a massive issue.
"
p233_229,"You have to do your research.
"
p233_230,"We played them off the pitch.
"
p233_231,"The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
"
p233_232,"Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
"
p233_233,"It's a question of creating a future awareness.
"
p233_234,"My neighbours are horrified.
"
p233_235,"But he failed to win the committee's support.
"
p233_236,"I can't wait to meet him.
"
p233_237,"Broke the birdie record.
"
p233_238,"Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
"
p233_239,"The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
"
p233_240,"The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
"
p233_241,"A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
"
p233_242,"We were extremely poor.
"
p233_243,"I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
"
p233_244,"Chambers said he would accept the place.
"
p233_245,"I know I'm in a very special position.
"
p233_246,"We did not compete with any other local farmer.
"
p233_247,"The salary changes are long overdue.
"
p233_248,"The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
"
p233_249,"It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
"
p233_250,"There wasn't a goal.
"
p233_251,"It was a cry for help.
"
p233_252,"A friendship that will endure.
"
p233_253,"This year I understood.
"
p233_254,"Her presence was almost everywhere.
"
p233_255,"For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
"
p233_256,"The distinction is also supported by doctors.
"
p233_257,"I watched a game.
"
p233_258,"There will be tough opponents to this report.
"
p233_259,"One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
"
p233_260,"I was happily surprised.
"
p233_261,"He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
"
p233_262,"It is also very valuable.
"
p233_263,"I've spent a lot of time on buses.
"
p233_264,"This court has made an order which has not been observed.
"
p233_265,"It is not just about pay.
"
p233_266,"Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
"
p233_267,"George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
"
p233_268,"Blood samples were taken.
"
p233_269,"They are never here.
"
p233_270,"That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
"
p233_271,"It looks as though he will be right.
"
p233_272,"We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
"
p233_273,"Immediate action must be taken.
"
p233_274,"He is a young man with a new deal.
"
p233_275,"It was an easy decision to come here.
"
p233_276,"It is the same in Sweden.
"
p233_277,"And Michael was just great.
"
p233_278,"It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
"
p233_279,"Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
"
p233_280,"She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
"
p233_281,"Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
"
p233_282,"However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
"
p233_283,"I feel pretty good.
"
p233_284,"They were on holiday in Egypt.
"
p233_285,"It was a privilege to work for him.
"
p233_286,"It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
"
p233_288,"They were too hard.
"
p233_289,"He looked very sharp.
"
p233_290,"All options are open.
"
p233_291,"The attacker died in the crash.
"
p233_292,"It was a virus.
"
p233_294,"I do not think this family will ever get over this.
"
p233_295,"Like his acting, it was an accident.
"
p233_296,"Sunday's game was not a trial.
"
p233_297,"Who can predict ?
"
p233_298,"This is a huge confidence boost.
"
p233_299,"I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
"
p233_300,"We have to sort it out ourselves.
"
p233_301,"That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
"
p233_302,"I thought it was my only chance.
"
p233_303,"One was a lawyer.
"
p233_304,"Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
"
p233_305,"They should be swept away.
"
p233_306,"This is a war over our home.
"
p233_307,"Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
"
p233_308,"I was in daily contact.
"
p233_309,"We want to play at the worlds.
"
p233_310,"This is the culture change in medicine.
"
p233_311,"Is there on his hands ?
"
p233_312,"We have got no money to go anywhere.
"
p233_313,"The election is total confusion and chaos.
"
p233_314,"It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
"
p233_315,"The problems began a long time ago.
"
p233_316,"My body is clearly capable.
"
p233_317,"We are very strongly behind the bid.
"
p233_319,"But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
"
p233_320,"My view has now completely changed.
"
p233_321,"It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
"
p233_322,"We agreed to disagree.
"
p233_323,"On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
"
p233_324,"I saw some good things.
"
p233_325,"Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
"
p233_326,"Robert is a special talent.
"
p233_327,"It added to the spectacle.
"
p233_328,"Who was the mystery MP ?
"
p233_329,"He told the court.
"
p233_330,"The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
"
p233_331,"Who will do it ?
"
p233_332,"However, Sharon rejected the claims.
"
p233_333,"Gaelic provision continued to be good.
"
p233_334,"He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
"
p233_335,"Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
"
p233_336,"The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
"
p233_337,"Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
"
p233_338,"Nobody else was with me.
"
p233_339,"I've learned from my mistakes.
"
p233_340,"I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
"
p233_341,"The composer will conduct.
"
p233_342,"I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
"
p233_343,"This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
"
p233_344,"His contract was then not renewed.
"
p233_345,"Eight months later, he was dead.
"
p233_346,"On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
"
p233_347,"He had played well in that central role.
"
p233_348,"The decision is an absolute disgrace.
"
p233_349,"Tyson is overwhelmed.
"
p233_350,"However, it was well worth the wait.
"
p233_351,"He agreed with my proposal.
"
p233_352,"Hartley should know.
"
p233_353,"Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
"
p233_354,"The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
"
p233_355,"It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
"
p233_356,"Also, it is the season of goodwill.
"
p233_357,"Equity declined to comment.
"
p233_358,"You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
"
p233_359,"He could make it.
"
p233_360,"The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
"
p233_361,"They have not done so this season so far.
"
p233_362,"This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
"
p233_363,"Safety was also an issue.
"
p233_364,"They received a reply from their own managers.
"
