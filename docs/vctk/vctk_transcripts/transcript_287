p287_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p287_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p287_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p287_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p287_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p287_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p287_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p287_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p287_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p287_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p287_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p287_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p287_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p287_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p287_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p287_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p287_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p287_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p287_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p287_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p287_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p287_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p287_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p287_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p287_025,"A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
"
p287_026,"In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
"
p287_027,"Meetings will also remain private.
"
p287_028,"On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
"
p287_029,"He has the courage of the unaware.
"
p287_030,"Life was like a timetable.
"
p287_031,"This is a central issue.
"
p287_032,"But a solution has been found.
"
p287_033,"I thought it was an accident.
"
p287_034,"President Bush is at war.
"
p287_035,"That period was a struggle.
"
p287_036,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p287_037,"But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
"
p287_038,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p287_039,"But it might have done.
"
p287_040,"There is no reason at all.
"
p287_041,"This will get their attention.
"
p287_042,"Must be prepared to use it.
"
p287_043,"He will need that machine.
"
p287_044,"I had come back from London.
"
p287_045,"I saw them last week.
"
p287_046,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p287_047,"There was no safety net.
"
p287_048,"The teacher would have approved.
"
p287_049,"It is quite a figure.
"
p287_050,"We have to look beyond the very short term.
"
p287_051,"It depends on the couple.
"
p287_052,"I expect a rapid response.
"
p287_053,"The motive for the shooting was not known.
"
p287_054,"In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
"
p287_055,"You do not change overnight.
"
p287_056,"We will pay their bills.
"
p287_057,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p287_058,"How are you, sir ?
"
p287_059,"So is that it, then ?
"
p287_060,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p287_061,"What do we do ?
"
p287_062,"It has been an amazing day.
"
p287_063,"Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
"
p287_064,"Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
"
p287_065,"This is a big step up.
"
p287_066,"There can be no compromise on welfare.
"
p287_067,"Both sides have been hit by injury.
"
p287_068,"Now the plot is perfect.
"
p287_069,"That would be too easy.
"
p287_070,"I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
"
p287_071,"It looks like a hit.
"
p287_072,"After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
"
p287_073,"I first met him last summer.
"
p287_074,"We did it for the jersey.
"
p287_075,"Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
"
p287_076,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p287_077,"Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
"
p287_078,"The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
"
p287_079,"That was a great performance by the team.
"
p287_080,"It was a total disaster.
"
p287_081,"I've never seen anything like it.
"
p287_082,"He added that he felt undermined.
"
p287_083,"It was not an insult.
"
p287_084,"In each case they were a goal down.
"
p287_085,"It was clear on Thursday.
"
p287_086,"We would hope to make progress on that next year.
"
p287_087,"FOR once, you should believe the hype.
"
p287_088,"But I know the course.
"
p287_089,"We intend to change the model.
"
p287_090,"Two of the team became ill.
"
p287_091,"No, the equipment is extra.
"
p287_092,"This decision is a farce.
"
p287_093,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p287_094,"The cause of the fire is not yet known.
"
p287_095,"It would be the end of farming.
"
p287_096,"It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
"
p287_097,"It's not a lack of confidence.
"
p287_098,"We have got a race.
"
p287_099,"He will go on the bench.
"
p287_100,"You had better believe it.
"
p287_101,"New Year will be very busy.
"
p287_102,"There's still plenty time left.
"
p287_103,"That was the first step.
"
p287_104,"I was impressed with them.
"
p287_105,"Such actions are rarely popular.
"
p287_106,"Mr Blair should be warned.
"
p287_107,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p287_108,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p287_109,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p287_110,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p287_111,"And does it ?
"
p287_112,"Then again, we could have.
"
p287_113,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p287_114,"We have a training class.
"
p287_115,"Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
"
p287_116,"We did what we had to do.
"
p287_117,"They made such decisions in London.
"
p287_118,"She was also very brave.
"
p287_119,"But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
"
p287_120,"You are a gambling man.
"
p287_121,"My conscience is not clear.
"
p287_122,"He is a great addition to our team.
"
p287_123,"I felt he was excellent.
"
p287_124,"We will try to find someone.
"
p287_125,"The money needs to go to the front line.
"
p287_126,"The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
"
p287_127,"I miss the freedom that I had.
"
p287_128,"But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
"
p287_129,"We had to add value.
"
p287_130,"Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
"
p287_131,"Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
"
p287_132,"That is the real test.
"
p287_133,"I would relish the prospect.
"
p287_134,"It has become a way of life.
"
p287_135,"We will provide immediate access.
"
p287_136,"It will clearly be discussed in cabinet.
"
p287_137,"Three hours later, the man was free.
"
p287_138,"It was deployed in the Gulf War.
"
p287_139,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p287_140,"Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
"
p287_141,"She had gone to the Catholic school.
"
p287_142,"It would seem a natural progression.
"
p287_143,"We will turn the corner.
"
p287_144,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p287_145,"This action reflects a slump in bookings.
"
p287_146,"The strong pound also took its toll.
"
p287_147,"These days are long gone.
"
p287_148,"I am a good player.
"
p287_149,"That shows the strength of the US Tour.
"
p287_150,"We have a budget in March.
"
p287_151,"The pension levels will remain the same.
"
p287_152,"You had to go and see him.
"
p287_153,"They could not match it.
"
p287_154,"The people are the hero.
"
p287_155,"Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
"
p287_156,"The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
"
p287_157,"First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
"
p287_158,"This much I can tell you.
"
p287_159,"The Hibs manager is no fool.
"
p287_160,"Phase one was a shambles.
"
p287_161,"The hotel was now for sale.
"
p287_162,"At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
"
p287_163,"Tomorrow is a new day.
"
p287_164,"What happened in that game ?
"
p287_165,"Are you going to win ?
"
p287_166,"Was it the wife ?
"
p287_167,"Why change it ?
"
p287_168,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p287_169,"His son is a local legend.
"
p287_170,"I am not ready to walk away.
"
p287_171,"Says the Duke of York.
"
p287_172,"Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
"
p287_173,"Our destiny is in our own hands.
"
p287_174,"They bought the property four years ago.
"
p287_175,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p287_176,"He is believed to live in Britain.
"
p287_177,"People like to talk about these things.
"
p287_178,"Being investor ready is a good start.
"
p287_179,"They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
"
p287_180,"We've had great things in the past.
"
p287_181,"It could be done by experts and lawyers.
"
p287_182,"DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
"
p287_183,"You know the sort of thing.
"
p287_184,"They were seriously after him.
"
p287_185,"However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
"
p287_186,"It was a pre-emptive strike.
"
p287_187,"It caused a lot of upset.
"
p287_188,"This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
"
p287_189,"Last night was a key episode.
"
p287_190,"We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
"
p287_191,"It is hard to tell.
"
p287_192,"I can't play the game for them.
"
p287_193,"I was inspired by two things.
"
p287_194,"They might be surprised by the response.
"
p287_195,"It comes from reflection or thinking.
"
p287_196,"This will be our new beginning.
"
p287_197,"The service from the other players was super.
"
p287_198,"However, it is not as simple as this.
"
p287_199,"The sanctions are about collective punishment.
"
p287_200,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p287_201,"Getting this right is essential.
"
p287_202,"Does the name matter ?
"
p287_203,"how do you get it back ?
"
p287_204,"What are you not good at ?
"
p287_205,"I think, therefore I am ?
"
p287_206,"Who was she ?
"
p287_207,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p287_208,"From there, they can go anywhere.
"
p287_209,"I had relied on him.
"
p287_210,"We used to live with dignity in our country.
"
p287_211,"This is a sensible and common sense approach.
"
p287_212,"It had all been arranged.
"
p287_213,"His third goal was superb.
"
p287_214,"It's all change at Kilmarnock.
"
p287_215,"His second was a beauty.
"
p287_216,"I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
"
p287_217,"I wouldn't even respond to that question.
"
p287_218,"And the World Cup has not even begun.
"
p287_219,"He remains a main board director of Royal.
"
p287_220,"The red card was okay.
"
p287_221,"It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
"
p287_222,"Women were mostly notable by their absence.
"
p287_223,"It will now take over the running of the estate.
"
p287_224,"The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
"
p287_225,"I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
"
p287_226,"Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
"
p287_227,"So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
"
p287_228,"We have learned a tremendous amount.
"
p287_229,"She died in middle age.
"
p287_230,"And thought we would get away with it.
"
p287_231,"We were a load of rubbish.
"
p287_232,"The trust was unable to pay the fourth interim dividend.
"
p287_233,"This is a family club.
"
p287_234,"They need to win a trophy.
"
p287_235,"I was ready for this.
"
p287_236,"I am still waiting for a reply.
"
p287_237,"Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
"
p287_238,"My future is in the marathon.
"
p287_239,"The effects are not all bad.
"
p287_240,"He would not impose a fine.
"
p287_241,"It was a fairy tale.
"
p287_242,"He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
"
p287_243,"She took them for a term.
"
p287_244,"In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
"
p287_245,"But that's another story for another day.
"
p287_246,"On a practical level, it would be difficult.
"
p287_247,"Persuaded to change his mind.
"
p287_248,"Either way, the investor retains the premium.
"
p287_249,"By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
"
p287_250,"Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
"
p287_251,"I should think so, too.
"
p287_252,"It makes no difference to their friendship.
"
p287_253,"No production contract is yet in sight.
"
p287_254,"Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
"
p287_255,"That you can do it.
"
p287_256,"He was on a horse.
"
p287_257,"The concerns are the same.
"
p287_258,"We are in a war.
"
p287_259,"It is not enough to be first division champions.
"
p287_260,"We run within the law.
"
p287_261,"On the contrary they stand to gain.
"
p287_262,"They are very keen to work with us.
"
p287_263,"That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
"
p287_264,"It does not work that way in Scottish football.
"
p287_265,"They must play for each other.
"
p287_266,"It is also very valuable.
"
p287_267,"There's not much money in cycling.
"
p287_268,"It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
"
p287_269,"The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
"
p287_270,"We're trying to get rounded performers.
"
p287_271,"This is a question of Islam.
"
p287_272,"And they were being paid ?
"
p287_273,"was everything done to save people ?
"
p287_274,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p287_275,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p287_276,"Is it in the right place ?
"
p287_277,"Did he trip ?
"
p287_278,"As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
"
p287_279,"Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
"
p287_280,"Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
"
p287_281,"It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
"
p287_282,"Frankly, we should all have such problems.
"
p287_283,"It was an easy decision to come here.
"
p287_284,"And Michael was just great.
"
p287_285,"Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
"
p287_286,"He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
"
p287_287,"He was dead on arrival at hospital.
"
p287_288,"It was never a free kick.
"
p287_289,"She failed in her action.
"
p287_290,"He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
"
p287_291,"We have to be very, very careful.
"
p287_292,"In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
"
p287_293,"The partnership was set up during the summer.
"
p287_294,"If not, he should go home.
"
p287_295,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p287_296,"Size is not the issue.
"
p287_297,"The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
"
p287_298,"But it is up again.
"
p287_299,"The rescue package is public money.
"
p287_300,"Either team will be hard.
"
p287_301,"That is the general feeling.
"
p287_302,"It has to be an event.
"
p287_303,"Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
"
p287_304,"We can work all night.
"
p287_305,"The answer is with ourselves.
"
p287_306,"Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott appealed for privacy.
"
p287_307,"There is no evidence for that.
"
p287_308,"I can hardly believe it.
"
p287_309,"Nothing has been put into action.
"
p287_310,"You are a different people.
"
p287_311,"Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
"
p287_312,"This will secure the future of our industry.
"
p287_313,"They are not left wing.
"
p287_314,"McNaughton was not so sure.
"
p287_315,"I was brought up in a mining background.
"
p287_316,"The City welcomed the numbers.
"
p287_317,"Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
"
p287_318,"This is a war over our home.
"
p287_319,"We have a good healthy debate.
"
p287_320,"And he goes with it.
"
p287_321,"I have signed a contract.
"
p287_322,"It is a court case.
"
p287_323,"However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
"
p287_324,"Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
"
p287_325,"However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
"
p287_326,"After some discussion they did.
"
p287_327,"The Premier League has been a huge success.
"
p287_328,"It wasn't a good day for us.
"
p287_329,"The show is at an end.
"
p287_330,"What form did that take ?
"
p287_331,"Are they free ?
"
p287_332,"What are they for ?
"
p287_333,"Is there a waiting list ?
"
p287_334,"Do they think anyone else wants them ?
"
p287_335,"So what happens next ?
"
p287_336,"It was an achievement all right.
"
p287_337,"My whole life has changed.
"
p287_338,"We are a peaceful people.
"
p287_339,"The election is total confusion and chaos.
"
p287_340,"You may have a short memory.
"
p287_341,"The problems began a long time ago.
"
p287_342,"A Home Office spokesman said.
"
p287_343,"In the old days, it was easy.
"
p287_344,"I think it's about time.
"
p287_345,"The airport was even different.
"
p287_346,"Other people had looked at it.
"
p287_347,"They are now out in the cold.
"
p287_348,"It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
"
p287_349,"It is a strong case.
"
p287_350,"My view has now completely changed.
"
p287_351,"Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
"
p287_352,"Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
"
p287_353,"It's wonderful to have won.
"
p287_354,"He was then replaced by Ross.
"
p287_355,"I'd like to take the plunge.
"
p287_356,"Appointments should be made on merit.
"
p287_357,"I have a moral dilemma.
"
p287_358,"Even the one she loved.
"
p287_359,"This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
"
