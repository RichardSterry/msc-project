p311_001,Please call Stella.
p311_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p311_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p311_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p311_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p311_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p311_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p311_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p311_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p311_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p311_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow."
p311_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p311_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p311_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p311_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p311_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p311_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p311_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p311_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p311_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p311_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p311_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p311_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p311_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p311_025,"No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different."
p311_026,It's ahead of Labour.
p311_027,It is the whole package.
p311_028,I was totally wrong.
p311_029,It was a matter of chance.
p311_030,"Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this."
p311_031,Miller was every bit as happy.
p311_032,We keep a distance.
p311_033,She went home from school and never returned.
p311_034,"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed."
p311_035,With actors it is slightly different.
p311_036,Green is desperate to play in The Open.
p311_037,They did a very good job.
p311_038,That's what we're still trying to do.
p311_039,"He tried to stop it, but it was already too late."
p311_040,We cannot go on in this fashion.
p311_041,We must learn to finish.
p311_042,There can be no two ways about it.
p311_043,I knew my contract was up this year.
p311_044,I am content with the silver.
p311_045,People acted too quickly.
p311_046,My heart is with the artist.
p311_047,That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
p311_048,There are different cultures in different departments.
p311_049,What would you do if you didn't work?
p311_050,They are already on the way there.
p311_051,The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p311_052,This is a holy place.
p311_053,We will miss him very much.
p311_054,"As a nation, we must become more active."
p311_055,They should go ahead as normal.
p311_056,"At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own."
p311_057,"It ended as it began, in confusion."
p311_058,I just went a bit too far.
p311_059,I am delighted for Simon.
p311_060,His third goal was superb.
p311_061,I don't have a problem with getting older.
p311_062,It has been declared.
p311_063,"Sure, that already happens in New Zealand."
p311_064,The scientific debate is dead.
p311_065,Only one got through.
p311_066,"In the end, however, it all came together."
p311_067,He is a visionary.
p311_068,I was the trial judge in both.
p311_069,I have a choice.
p311_070,It happens in many countries.
p311_071,It's not just about the shows.
p311_072,But the cost to his health was enormous.
p311_073,I have spoken to the skipper.
p311_074,Already the children are dying.
p311_075,Craig is a major concern for us.
p311_076,"We don't do this for everyone, of course."
p311_077,I can't wait to meet him.
p311_078,THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p311_079,It's the same as Glasgow.
p311_080,We've got a job to do.
p311_081,You just have to adjust.
p311_082,"Well, that's just a third district."
p311_083,"I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth."
p311_084,They are there to help us.
p311_085,"He added, We are not prepared for war."
p311_086,My wife and family are the support system.
p311_087,"Sub Not Used, McArthur."
p311_088,I have hardly any commitments.
p311_089,"The role was a knockout, but really difficult."
p311_090,It is a very special place.
p311_091,Some things in life you have to accept.
p311_092,I am relishing the challenge.
p311_093,It is set in Paris.
p311_094,The party has never fully recovered.
p311_095,Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.
p311_096,Surely history will not repeat itself.
p311_097,The initial report has been completed.
p311_098,He's got me very well.
p311_099,It's like an extension of your body.
p311_100,It is quite a new prescription.
p311_101,Johnsen is equally concerned.
p311_102,"Which he is, too."
p311_103,These matters are now behind us.
p311_104,But things are never the same again.
p311_105,It is easy to agree with him.
p311_106,"He, too, will return."
p311_107,Is there anything in the wound?
p311_108,Chambers said he would accept the place.
p311_109,Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p311_110,It is not really used by many people.
p311_111,There could be no dispute about our history.
p311_112,He has one son and one daughter.
p311_113,Don't get me wrong.
p311_114,It is nearly there.
p311_115,Otherwise we will pay the price.
p311_116,I find it rather oppressive.
p311_117,They are all Arabs.
p311_118,It is already making a difference.
p311_119,He decides to do something about it.
p311_120,There were no new cases yesterday.
p311_121,Someone else has now got them.
p311_122,But once again it was not converted.
p311_123,These figures are truly terrible.
p311_124,This is a most serious matter.
p311_125,I let go the telephone and ran.
p311_126,Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
p311_127,"After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show."
p311_128,It was a bit of a shock.
p311_129,The hearing was continued until a later date.
p311_130,"Still, some additions are inspired."
p311_131,Planning is a key issue.
p311_132,Did he always want to be a comedian?
p311_133,The way ahead is not easy.
p311_134,I could do a better job.
p311_135,Yet what is supposed to be said?
p311_136,Parole isn't a decision for me.
p311_137,I get the bus.
p311_138,We are still the best team in Britain.
p311_139,They got the job done.
p311_140,It's a horrific incident.
p311_141,"They have been contrasting years, certainly."
p311_142,"Four minutes later, the show was over."
p311_143,We've not won anything yet.
p311_144,They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p311_145,"There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!"
p311_146,They did not let him down.
p311_147,I believe in trade unions.
p311_148,This is in a league of its own.
p311_149,It's been such a waste of money.
p311_150,The money is not really our concern.
p311_151,You just know it.
p311_152,"Now, she has completed a family tradition."
p311_153,I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
p311_154,We have the easy part.
p311_155,"At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news."
p311_156,It's like a high school play.
p311_157,He was part of South Africa.
p311_158,It's there for people to look at.
p311_159,The party will make up its own mind.
p311_160,At least two women were among those arrested.
p311_161,They never got into the show this time.
p311_162,"But no, it's not funny."
p311_163,"In that case, the children were not missing."
p311_164,He changed my life.
p311_165,There was nothing else to match it.
p311_166,Two options are being proposed.
p311_167,They haven't been thought through.
p311_168,The criteria have changed.
p311_169,"O, Is there a lot of blood?"
p311_170,"Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved."
p311_171,I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p311_172,He was at home with his pals.
p311_173,This is a very interesting move.
p311_174,The highest rate is in Glasgow.
p311_175,His only reply was a laugh.
p311_176,those who are preparing to give up.
p311_177,What kind of festival is proposed?
p311_178,I was delighted with every one of them.
p311_179,Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p311_180,"Finally, they have a journey back to their youth."
p311_181,That will help my case a bit.
p311_182,It was entirely justified.
p311_183,He looked at me before replying.
p311_184,This may be perfectly innocent.
p311_185,It feels that the game is off.
p311_186,There will be no change in government.
p311_187,"Another man said, It was horrible."
p311_188,But we still don't know.
p311_189,Who do you think you are?
p311_190,Glasgow is a tour de force.
p311_191,I have no battle with the Scots.
p311_192,It is all credit to them today.
p311_193,I have done ever since it was published.
p311_194,Nobody could survive on that.
p311_195,They seem to turn up for them.
p311_196,They were kept there for a summer.
p311_197,He confirmed there had been no warning.
p311_198,It is that sort of film.
p311_199,She was not hard done by.
p311_200,Can you believe it?
p311_201,I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p311_202,They are now out in the cold.
p311_203,"However, planners should be taking the lead."
p311_204,I'm very frightened of the dark.
p311_205,Our message was inclusive.
p311_206,This has been a shock.
p311_207,Yet the survey has been cautious.
p311_208,Everything in the symphony is there.
p311_209,There has also been some Scots input.
p311_210,"This time, he will be more on the defensive."
p311_211,There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p311_212,But who will buy it?
p311_213,It had to be more flexible.
p311_214,Openness is always the best way.
p311_215,It wouldn't go off.
p311_216,It can be halted.
p311_217,This was a lot of numbers.
p311_218,Would it be good for the Nationwide League?
p311_219,"Last night, she refused to comment on the accident."
p311_220,The whole thing has been a nightmare.
p311_221,He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p311_222,The professor said the results were positive.
p311_223,"I think he's the favourite, no question."
p311_224,But it's just great to have won.
p311_225,And it paid off.
p311_226,Gone with them is any sense of narrative.
p311_227,"Those Were The Days, indeed."
p311_228,I never made any offer to Mark.
p311_229,It should be scrapped.
p311_230,He admitted the asylum system was not working.
p311_231,They are just trying to cover up.
p311_232,We have to defend ourselves.
p311_233,I came here this week to work.
p311_234,Where do we go from here?
p311_235,Barry Ferguson is one of them.
p311_236,He gets his moment.
p311_237,This was an option from the beginning.
p311_238,Clearly he is keeping in touch.
p311_239,"It's not a party, no, no."
p311_240,It's not that clear-cut.
p311_241,It may not be life long.
p311_242,It was just above the roof.
p311_243,"It has changed, and not for the better."
p311_244,"However, that is a sizeable if."
p311_245,Everyone must be focused on the league.
p311_246,The English are coming.
p311_247,I believe in theatre.
p311_248,Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
p311_249,"However, many of their victories have been close affairs."
p311_250,It's time to say enough is enough.
p311_251,"Mentally, you have to be tough."
p311_252,He has to pull back from the brink.
p311_253,She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
p311_254,That's my daughter acting.
p311_255,The film has also been superbly designed.
p311_256,"The performance was really, really immense."
p311_257,Faces from the Eighties.
p311_258,The family baton is handed on.
p311_259,How can this be?
p311_260,We are still alive and kicking.
p311_261,I want to go now.
p311_262,There are many questions to be answered.
p311_263,Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
p311_264,All the children on the roll are genuine.
p311_265,They said we were out of touch.
p311_266,"Sub Not Used, McCormick."
p311_267,There is no signature.
p311_268,There is no point in denying that.
p311_269,The kids are paying the price.
p311_270,He said he was delighted by the award.
p311_271,They didn't find any substance.
p311_272,They still have the dirty work to do.
p311_273,I've never seen a game like it.
p311_274,It doesn't seem like that long ago.
p311_275,He will do very well.
p311_276,They also intend to travel today.
p311_277,There's a lot of hysteria.
p311_278,The casualties were not named.
p311_279,I was shaking on the blocks.
p311_280,There are two ways to start a festival.
p311_281,I am very happy with life.
p311_282,Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
p311_283,My office is down there.
p311_284,Even then this game was not over.
p311_285,Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.
p311_286,We also hope to meet the men.
p311_287,The defender made an impressive debut.
p311_288,It has become very confused.
p311_289,Fame and money followed.
p311_290,I am not in denial.
p311_291,Shelter also supports the reform.
p311_292,The attack was totally out of the blue.
p311_293,"There is a solution, she believes."
p311_294,So there is a very real dilemma.
p311_295,I can't believe we didn't win that game.
p311_296,Then there's the Old Firm.
p311_297,I seem to keep this for the majors.
p311_298,"We were in different places, usually in cellars."
p311_299,They're not always the same person.
p311_300,It would have to be backdated.
p311_301,He said he was sorry.
p311_302,My position on the euro is quite clear.
p311_303,"Well, it did last time, he was reminded."
p311_304,We have worked well with them for years.
p311_305,That was me today.
p311_306,That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p311_307,That is when we are really effective.
p311_308,The director's a genius.
p311_309,There was no sign that anything was amiss.
p311_310,It was the climax of the thing.
p311_311,This is new money.
p311_312,We have not given up on the game.
p311_313,The decision was left entirely to him.
p311_314,"Yes, it was uplifting."
p311_315,Nobody should believe this story.
p311_316,This is not out of choice.
p311_317,"But don't just take my word, for it."
p311_318,But this one has a lot of potential.
p311_319,It's a big challenge for the audience.
p311_320,We'll see what happens.
p311_321,This was another video cassette.
p311_322,"If that is the perception, that has to be addressed."
p311_323,It will make a huge difference.
p311_324,He pretended not to care.
p311_325,Not because they want to sing about something.
p311_326,I was in tears in the street.
p311_327,"Eriksson, though, was having none of it."
p311_328,No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.
p311_329,But that's not the idea behind this article.
p311_330,"If he could've prevented it happening, he would have."
p311_331,That is why we are here.
p311_332,The German had a point to make.
p311_333,"This time, however, may have been different."
p311_334,You have to feel for the guy.
p311_335,"However, the second goal was about to be delivered."
p311_336,Bomber was not amused.
p311_337,They would have been forgiven for doing so.
p311_338,Was it just negligent.
p311_339,And suddenly it became a free-for-all.
p311_340,This Government is cutting taxes.
p311_341,Things don't look too good at the moment.
p311_342,This is a big club.
p311_343,"I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't."
p311_344,They will now get that support.
p311_345,I feel it's time to make the switch.
p311_346,It seemed so personal.
p311_347,I've no problem with what they said.
p311_348,He added that he felt undermined.
p311_349,I think we have got the balance right.
p311_350,Eriksson would have approved.
p311_351,It is physical but it is also good.
p311_352,His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p311_353,Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p311_354,So it goes on.
p311_355,We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p311_356,I hope they will understand the reasons.
p311_357,They should have listened to me.
p311_358,I am greatly encouraged.
p311_359,It was like someone had died.
p311_360,What does he want him to look like?
p311_361,The actors are confident and polished.
p311_362,I hope he would have been very pleased.
p311_363,We would have concerns about that.
p311_364,Taxes may need to rise.
p311_365,It's unusual to say the least.
p311_366,All inquiries should be made to the police.
p311_367,Our Great Depression is our lives.
p311_368,I just did not cope with the pressure.
p311_369,We have some concerns.
p311_370,So he was anxious to try something new.
p311_371,This was a chilling echo.
p311_372,They really want to do it.
p311_373,And then he laughs.
p311_374,I recommend a tour.
p311_375,We don't ask for much.
p311_376,We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p311_377,I had a wonderful time working with him.
p311_378,We have to start again on Saturday.
p311_379,It feels like a winner already.
p311_380,And it covers the spectrum.
p311_381,The replacements made a big difference.
p311_382,And the winners are.
p311_383,"Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often."
p311_384,"He didn't really, we just made that up."
p311_385,Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p311_386,There are big names.
p311_387,My players are precious to me.
p311_388,That argument has been won.
p311_389,"Normally, they have been a pack of lies."
p311_390,"For us, that decision was hard to understand."
p311_391,I had to calm down.
p311_392,Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p311_393,She returned home a few days later.
p311_394,They haven't run away.
p311_395,Nobody can take it away from me.
p311_396,She is fulfilled by it.
p311_397,He said no survivors had been found.
p311_398,Who can say?
p311_399,It is the end of an era.
p311_400,"In short, the club was broke."
p311_401,"Sadly, in this case, that was not so."
p311_402,She is a veteran in the Balkans.
p311_403,The men are safe and unharmed.
p311_404,We're not the tourist board.
p311_405,It was the same old story.
p311_406,I was frustrated here.
p311_407,We have reacted well to each other.
p311_408,Are you watching Liverpool?
p311_409,I was furious about it.
p311_410,This will be no easy option.
p311_411,They knew they shouldn't have been there.
p311_412,Of course we aren't.
p311_413,We haven't been told.
p311_414,It worked well in Monaco.
p311_415,They were outside the circle.
p311_416,The whole process was so different.
p311_417,He also called in at another farm.
p311_418,I agree with them.
