p249_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p249_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p249_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p249_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p249_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p249_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p249_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p249_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p249_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p249_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p249_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p249_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p249_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p249_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p249_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p249_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p249_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p249_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p249_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p249_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p249_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p249_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p249_025,"She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
"
p249_026,"Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
"
p249_027,"It's nice to hear.
"
p249_028,"They should be so lucky.
"
p249_029,"Because we do not need it.
"
p249_030,"There's a story, too.
"
p249_031,"Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
"
p249_032,"He took me on a tour of the wards.
"
p249_033,"A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
"
p249_034,"IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
"
p249_035,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p249_036,"It was clear.
"
p249_037,"It is not for any other purpose.
"
p249_038,"He did not know his daughter.
"
p249_039,"She is believed to be in South Africa.
"
p249_040,"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
"
p249_041,"Sure, it's funny.
"
p249_042,"It's a crucial award.
"
p249_043,"The boy is no longer with us.
"
p249_044,"It's a blessing.
"
p249_045,"Is a drug dealer?
"
p249_046,"As she explains.
"
p249_047,"He is too weak to move.
"
p249_048,"He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
"
p249_049,"I would love to have him home.
"
p249_050,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p249_051,"No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
"
p249_052,"It will come all right.
"
p249_053,"However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
"
p249_054,"Next league matches Celtic.
"
p249_055,"It happens from time to time.
"
p249_056,"It's very odd.
"
p249_057,"Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
"
p249_058,"It is unique.
"
p249_059,"It will take time.
"
p249_060,"That's the truth.
"
p249_061,"Jobs could go.
"
p249_062,"The problems are a result of that shortfall.
"
p249_063,"I'm just enjoying every match.
"
p249_064,"And a film maker was born.
"
p249_065,"You did not change overnight.
"
p249_066,"There was a battle there.
"
p249_067,"Scotland had great assets.
"
p249_068,"I've spent a lot of time on buses.
"
p249_069,"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
"
p249_070,"Have a look at our accounts.
"
p249_071,"It is like a river running by my home.
"
p249_072,"Try to save us.
"
p249_073,"He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
"
p249_074,"Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
"
p249_075,"Painful, but only because it's true.
"
p249_076,"The play is based on a real-life event.
"
p249_077,"It's very difficult to find a buyer.
"
p249_078,"He highlighted a lack of staff.
"
p249_079,"They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
"
p249_080,"Both sides have been hit by injury.
"
p249_081,"The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
"
p249_082,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p249_083,"Even the one she loved.
"
p249_084,"I've not thought about it.
"
p249_086,"Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
"
p249_087,"That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
"
p249_088,"She had kept the news from him.
"
p249_089,"He seems to be pleased with the picture.
"
p249_090,"When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
"
p249_092,"Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
"
p249_093,"And rugby fans can help.
"
p249_094,"They lived for their children.
"
p249_095,"The city council is a major property owner in the area.
"
p249_096,"Now the system is right behind us.
"
p249_097,"Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
"
p249_098,"Today I couldn't run on it.
"
p249_099,"However, it did not end that way.
"
p249_100,"We must look forward.
"
p249_101,"It is an old family habit.
"
p249_102,"That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
"
p249_103,"Until you hit the big games.
"
p249_104,"Then came the crunch.
"
p249_105,"The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
"
p249_106,"We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
"
p249_107,"He is hungry for success and I am the same.
"
p249_108,"The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
"
p249_109,"It is a good day for the coalition.
"
p249_110,"A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
"
p249_111,"We want to get to the final, anyway.
"
p249_112,"It is a good lifestyle.
"
p249_113,"It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
"
p249_114,"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
"
p249_115,"You had better believe it.
"
p249_116,"Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
"
p249_117,"It's a long process.
"
p249_118,"They were behind the wheel.
"
p249_119,"It was ugly.
"
p249_120,"Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
"
p249_121,"This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
"
p249_122,"Does this mean.
"
p249_123,"They've got to account for it.
"
p249_124,"Who would have?
"
p249_125,"The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
"
p249_126,"You can spend money on housing.
"
p249_127,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p249_128,"It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
"
p249_129,"His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
"
p249_130,"It's the traumatic event in the childhood of a nation.
"
p249_131,"Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
"
p249_132,"Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
"
p249_133,"She said she could not believe that they had run away.
"
p249_134,"We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
"
p249_135,"Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
"
p249_136,"What will happen then?
"
p249_137,"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
"
p249_138,"Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
"
p249_139,"It was very frightened and dirty.
"
p249_140,"I was the last man to touch the ball.
"
p249_141,"It's a question of fashion.
"
p249_142,"We need to chat.
"
p249_143,"Wallace was a prisoner of war.
"
p249_144,"He is severe.
"
p249_145,"It is difficult for Ali.
"
p249_146,"Is that Titanic?
"
p249_147,"Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
"
p249_148,"The idea is simple.
"
p249_149,"That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
"
p249_150,"It is like a football team.
"
p249_152,"It is not just about pay.
"
p249_153,"The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
"
p249_154,"The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
"
p249_155,"The weaknesses are few.
"
p249_156,"The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
"
p249_157,"It is not normal practice.
"
p249_159,"It was by the numbers.
"
p249_160,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p249_161,"There's a pause.
"
p249_162,"Neither side can win this war.
"
p249_163,"They should stop the bombing.
"
p249_164,"Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
"
p249_165,"These days are long gone.
"
p249_166,"It is an attitude of mind.
"
p249_167,"It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
"
p249_168,"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
"
p249_169,"They say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.
"
p249_170,"I'm so worried about the roads.
"
p249_171,"We have to move forward.
"
p249_172,"Tell it like it was?
"
p249_173,"It is not too late to get on board.
"
p249_174,"We have a budget in March.
"
p249_176,"Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
"
p249_177,"As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
"
p249_178,"The release attracted little attention.
"
p249_179,"Someone who cares
"
p249_180,"I always felt they played for me.
"
p249_181,"You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
"
p249_182,"The jury is still out.
"
p249_183,"But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
"
p249_184,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p249_185,"It is not either national standards or local control.
"
p249_186,"It should be easy.
"
p249_187,"Everyone can be bought.
"
p249_188,"We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
"
p249_189,"We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
"
p249_190,"And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
"
p249_191,"It is not fair.
"
p249_192,"Miller was every bit as happy.
"
p249_193,"We want to help them through it.
"
p249_194,"I put the drawing down.
"
p249_196,"I had a train to catch.
"
p249_197,"It is tough, but possible.
"
p249_198,"We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
"
p249_199,"However, this idea is never developed.
"
p249_200,"Last night was a key episode.
"
p249_201,"We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
"
p249_202,"It is a case of taking a risk.
"
p249_203,"I wanted to put myself on the line.
"
p249_204,"Sir Paul McCartney said he had been shocked by the attack.
"
p249_205,"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
"
p249_206,"There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
"
p249_207,"The service from the other players was super.
"
p249_208,"He has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.
"
p249_209,"I have a cold.
"
p249_210,"On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
"
p249_211,"Ferguson should take note.
"
p249_212,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p249_213,"The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
"
p249_214,"It's all about money, money, money.
"
p249_216,"We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
"
p249_217,"This is a good move for me.
"
p249_218,"But I am a worried man.
"
p249_219,"There was an e-mail.
"
p249_220,"Feel the heat?
"
p249_221,"We'll have to work hard today.
"
p249_222,"Twaddle is a case in point.
"
p249_223,"It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
"
p249_224,"The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
"
p249_225,"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
"
p249_226,"The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
"
p249_229,"Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
"
p249_230,"And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
"
p249_231,"It is a gamble.
"
p249_232,"My neighbours are horrified.
"
p249_234,"He is in the queue.
"
p249_235,"Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
"
p249_236,"Broke the birdie record.
"
p249_237,"The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
"
p249_238,"We were a load of rubbish.
"
p249_239,"Half of young people had had contact with the police.
"
p249_240,"It's a lovely, lovely film.
"
p249_241,"Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
"
p249_243,"The problem in Norway is outside the National.
"
p249_244,"We have a free vote on these things in our party.
"
p249_245,"We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
"
p249_246,"I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
"
p249_247,"There wasn't a goal.
"
p249_248,"I was shocked.
"
p249_249,"I should think so, too.
"
p249_251,"Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
"
p249_252,"He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
"
p249_253,"At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
"
p249_254,"It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
"
p249_255,"It is very important that we get the balance right.
"
p249_256,"It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
"
p249_257,"One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
"
p249_258,"They must play for each other.
"
p249_259,"His contract was then not renewed.
"
p249_260,"He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
"
p249_261,"That's the only thing I will say.
"
p249_262,"Blood samples were taken.
"
p249_263,"They are never here.
"
p249_265,"He has not created a Festival resource.
"
p249_266,"He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
"
p249_267,"Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
"
p249_268,"It is the same in Sweden.
"
p249_269,"And Michael was just great.
"
p249_270,"It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
"
p249_271,"It's not even finished.
"
p249_272,"Our objective is to tackle poverty.
"
p249_273,"Things can change.
"
p249_274,"She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
"
p249_275,"People have no choice.
"
p249_276,"Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
"
p249_277,"He has a wealth of experience.
"
p249_278,"Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
"
p249_279,"For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
"
p249_280,"There's nothing I can say.
"
p249_281,"Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
"
p249_282,"This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
"
p249_283,"You've got to have both sides.
"
p249_284,"What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
"
p249_285,"Motherwell have no such good fortune.
"
p249_286,"The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
"
p249_287,"The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
"
p249_288,"Scotland were beaten again.
"
p249_289,"A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
"
p249_290,"I do not think this family will ever get over this.
"
p249_291,"These figures are truly awful.
"
p249_292,"He should have won.
"
p249_293,"Sunday's game was not a trial.
"
p249_294,"A new school will be built.
"
p249_295,"The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
"
p249_296,"Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
"
p249_297,"What has altered?
"
p249_298,"However, the snow was welcomed by some.
"
p249_299,"He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
"
p249_300,"Our task is to complete the picture.
"
p249_301,"A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
"
p249_302,"They are wrong.
"
p249_303,"Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
"
p249_304,"The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
"
p249_305,"Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
"
p249_306,"They were on holiday in Egypt.
"
p249_307,"I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
"
p249_308,"And he goes with it.
"
p249_309,"It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
"
p249_310,"However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
"
p249_311,"A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
"
p249_312,"I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
"
p249_313,"Is there on his hands?
"
p249_314,"Special measures were needed.
"
p249_315,"They were fantastic.
"
p249_316,"In fact, they have the opposite effect.
"
p249_317,"They wanted the club to make money.
"
p249_318,"The problems began a long time ago.
"
p249_319,"Referees are easy targets.
"
p249_320,"Davis is very supportive, as a director.
"
p249_321,"I came into this world with nothing.
"
p249_322,"That's the law of the land.
"
p249_323,"There was no time scale.
"
p249_324,"I am so upset.
"
p249_326,"It could have gone either way.
"
p249_327,"He was then replaced by Ross.
"
p249_328,"My view has now completely changed.
"
p249_329,"In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
"
p249_330,"Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
"
p249_331,"The same things will happen with GM foods.
"
p249_332,"Who will do it?
"
p249_335,"I must make that clear.
"
p249_336,"The train was on time.
"
p249_337,"A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
"
p249_338,"The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
"
p249_339,"That is the very reason why it was so vital.
"
p249_340,"In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
"
p249_341,"I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
"
p249_342,"He's a genius.
"
p249_343,"They should take their mobile phones.
"
p249_344,"From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
"
p249_345,"Eight months later, he was dead.
"
p249_347,"It's all going to clear the debt.
"
p249_348,"He had played well in that central role.
"
p249_349,"The decision is an absolute disgrace.
"
p249_350,"It is horrible.
"
p249_351,"It was very formal.
"
p249_352,"Both of those promises have already been honoured.
"
p249_353,"I kept going for her.
"
p249_354,"In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
"
