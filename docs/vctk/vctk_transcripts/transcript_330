p330_001,Please call Stella.
p330_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p330_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p330_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p330_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p330_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p330_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p330_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p330_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p330_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p330_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p330_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p330_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p330_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p330_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p330_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p330_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p330_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p330_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p330_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p330_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p330_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p330_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p330_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p330_025,"Like anyone else, he has to take his time."
p330_026,I was backing him up.
p330_027,"It is not an option, but a policy requirement."

p330_064,"One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services."
p330_065,We have to expand.
p330_066,Others may be trying to catch up.
p330_067,We gave everything we had.
p330_068,I think it is a release of tension.
p330_069,This is a most serious matter.
p330_070,I let go the telephone and ran.
p330_071,It is also very valuable.
p330_072,We're trying to lessen the stigma.

p330_089,"However, you have just got to adjust to it."
p330_090,Everything has the potential to be serious.
p330_091,Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p330_092,"Everything will fall into place, it should be fine."
