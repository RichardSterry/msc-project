p269_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p269_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p269_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p269_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p269_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p269_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p269_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p269_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p269_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p269_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p269_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p269_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p269_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p269_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p269_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p269_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p269_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p269_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p269_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p269_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p269_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases. 
"
p269_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of the number of bows. 
"
p269_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p269_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p269_025,"She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
"
p269_026,"But it failed.
"
p269_027,"He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
"
p269_028,"In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
"
p269_029,"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
"
p269_030,"I have a theory.
"
p269_031,"Is this accurate?
"
p269_032,"Because we do not need it.
"
p269_033,"He took me on a tour of the wards.
"
p269_034,"Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
"
p269_035,"Help is needed.
"
p269_036,"A web site is planned for November.
"
p269_037,"It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
"
p269_038,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p269_039,"That's no bad thing.
"
p269_040,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p269_041,"She is believed to be in South Africa.
"
p269_042,"I was scared.
"
p269_043,"It was ugly.
"
p269_044,"There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
"
p269_045,"Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
"
p269_046,"We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
"
p269_047,"Who can say?
"
p269_048,"He had no enemies.
"
p269_049,"Her body was found about four miles from the car.
"
p269_050,"I was inspired by two things.
"
p269_051,"Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
"
p269_052,"It's very odd.
"
p269_053,"We have not given up hope.
"
p269_054,"This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
"
p269_055,"New York is expected to come to a standstill.
"
p269_056,"We are a grandmother.
"
p269_057,"None has ever been found.
"
p269_058,"You do not change overnight.
"
p269_059,"Art is extra.
"
p269_060,"They're appalled by that.
"
p269_061,"There was a battle there.
"
p269_062,"Scotland had great assets.
"
p269_063,"It's that kind of place.
"
p269_064,"They are real.
"
p269_065,"I've spent a lot of time on buses.
"
p269_066,"Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
"
p269_067,"We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
"
p269_068,"You need a trademark.
"
p269_069,"Painful, but only because it's true.
"
p269_070,"I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
"
p269_071,"It's a winner.
"
p269_072,"There could be a way back.
"
p269_073,"I was as strong as a horse.
"
p269_074,"Both sides have been hit by injury.
"
p269_075,"The girls are so lucky to be alive.
"
p269_076,"It is a job creation scheme.

"
p269_078,"He is now resident in England.
"
p269_079,"Even the one she loved.
"
p269_080,"People must remain vigilant.
"
p269_081,"This is the way things should be handled.
"
p269_082,"It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
"
p269_083,"I'd like to continue that record.
"
p269_084,"That is bound to happen.
"
p269_085,"That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
"
p269_086,"All options are open.
"
p269_087,"Someone who cares
"
p269_088,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p269_089,"You will be.
"
p269_090,"He put some colour into Scottish history.
"
p269_091,"We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
"
p269_092,"The name on the passport and other details have not been disclosed.
"
p269_093,"Today I couldn't run on it.
"
p269_094,"They've got to account for it.
"
p269_096,"Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
"
p269_097,"Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
"
p269_098,"An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
"
p269_099,"However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
"
p269_100,"May not have been at fault?
"
p269_101,"We want to get to the final, anyway.
"
p269_102,"Oil embargo endorsed.
"
p269_103,"But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
"
p269_104,"No date has been set for the appeal.
"
p269_105,"It's not perfect.
"
p269_106,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p269_107,"He pleaded for caution.
"
p269_108,"It was quite rigorous.
"
p269_109,"I was fighting for my life, I thought.
"
p269_110,"I can't even get into the A team.
"
p269_111,"The picture is the same across Scotland.
"
p269_112,"It was the eighties.
"
p269_113,"We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
"
p269_114,"It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
"
p269_115,"Maybe this battle has been.
"
p269_116,"My office is bare.
"
p269_117,"Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
"
p269_118,"This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
"
p269_119,"It was a delight on every level.
"
p269_121,"We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
"
p269_122,"She has been shot.
"
p269_123,"I thought it was a fantastic game.

"
p269_126,"His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
"
p269_127,"Next season for every manager is a long time away.
"
p269_128,"It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
"
p269_129,"It's terrible that he has died the same way.
"
p269_130,"So the European elections are extremely important.
"
p269_131,"Offered the gold medal, he declined.
"
p269_132,"Who will attend?
"
p269_133,"Twaddle is a case in point.
"
p269_134,"We had a reunion last week.
"
p269_135,"The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
"
p269_136,"The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
"
p269_137,"It's the big omission.
"
p269_138,"If not, a deal could take many months.
"
p269_139,"What will happen then?
"
p269_140,"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
"
p269_141,"We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
"
p269_142,"It's a question of fashion.
"
p269_143,"He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
"
p269_144,"It seems so long since I did the exams.
"
p269_145,"And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
"
p269_146,"Wallace was a prisoner of war.
"
p269_147,"We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
"
p269_148,"He is severe.
"
p269_149,"We just had a go.
"
p269_150,"She died at her home.
"
p269_151,"We have seen a copy of the report.
"
p269_152,"They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
"
p269_153,"That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
"
p269_154,"It's like a football team.
"
p269_155,"It would be a last resort.
"
p269_156,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p269_157,"He will emerge as a world leader.
"
p269_158,"The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
"
p269_159,"I was so nervous.
"
p269_160,"We want to see the maximum of change.
"
p269_161,"Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
"
p269_162,"His death was a tragic accident.
"
p269_163,"This latter point is hugely important.
"
p269_164,"It is so unfair.
"
p269_165,"It is an attitude of mind.
"
p269_166,"I've put my own money into this project.
"
p269_167,"They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
"
p269_168,"I am now unemployed.
"
p269_169,"Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
"
p269_170,"We have to move forward.
"
p269_171,"We knew we had the goal we wanted.
"
p269_172,"I lost my head.
"
p269_173,"Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
"
p269_174,"Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
"
p269_175,"Waiting times for these services are too long.
"
p269_176,"They thought they had found a home.
"
p269_177,"His team management was protective.
"
p269_179,"But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
"
p269_180,"It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
"
p269_181,"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
"
p269_182,"I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
"
p269_183,"Everyone can be bought.
"
p269_184,"The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
"
p269_185,"They know no other way.
"
p269_186,"It's an idea.
"
p269_187,"They will run a mile.
"
p269_188,"Four policemen were wounded.
"
p269_189,"We did everything by the book.
"
p269_190,"Does this matter?
"
p269_191,"My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
"
p269_193,"It had been in place since last July.
"
p269_194,"I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
"
p269_195,"Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
"
p269_196,"We must keep our feet on the ground.
"
p269_197,"Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
"
p269_198,"The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
"
p269_199,"The conference is the first test.
"
p269_200,"We played them off the pitch.
"
p269_201,"He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
"
p269_202,"On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
"
p269_203,"It was good fun.
"
p269_204,"The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
"
p269_205,"It's all about money, money, money.
"
p269_206,"Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
"
p269_207,"I had been at the Evening Standard for two years.
"
p269_208,"After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
"
p269_209,"But I am a worried man.
"
p269_210,"This gives a financial incentive to switch.
"
p269_211,"Saddam Hussein is a devil.
"
p269_212,"Feel the heat?
"
p269_213,"HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
"
p269_214,"We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
"
p269_215,"I began to pray.
"
p269_216,"I am delighted for Simon.
"
p269_217,"It had all been arranged.
"
p269_218,"A Grampian Police spokesman said.
"
p269_219,"I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
"
p269_220,"The attacker has been put in foster care.

"
p269_223,"The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
"
p269_224,"Who was on the panel?
"
p269_225,"Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
"
p269_226,"It's so special.
"
p269_227,"The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
"
p269_228,"Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
"
p269_229,"I have spoken to the skipper.
"
p269_230,"I'd never seen a play about me.
"
p269_231,"It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
"
p269_232,"My neighbours are horrified.
"
p269_233,"But she was.
"
p269_234,"It's like a basketball.
"
p269_235,"And thought we would get away with it.
"
p269_236,"Of course, that is not the whole story.
"
p269_237,"Half of young people had had contact with the police.
"
p269_238,"Well, they were the unlucky ones.
"
p269_239,"The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
"
p269_240,"It's quite nice.
"
p269_241,"On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
"
p269_242,"A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
"
p269_243,"It would still have been a good film, but very different.
"
p269_244,"In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
"
p269_245,"It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
"
p269_246,"I know I'm in a very special position.
"
p269_247,"You can feel at home in China.
"
p269_248,"Some families have even requested to leave the city.
"
p269_249,"The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
"
p269_250,"It's a record label, not a form of music.
"
p269_251,"I was shocked.
"
p269_252,"I should think so, too.
"
p269_253,"We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
"
p269_254,"Her presence was almost everywhere.
"
p269_255,"I can't get a job.
"
p269_256,"It is nearly there.
"
p269_257,"Special measures were needed.
"
p269_258,"For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
"
p269_259,"The distinction is also supported by doctors.
"
p269_260,"It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
"
p269_261,"Kirkwood was arrested.
"
p269_263,"I am very angry.
"
p269_264,"It is also very valuable.
"
p269_265,"This court has made an order which has not been observed.
"
p269_266,"The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
"
p269_267,"The warning is timely.
"
p269_268,"Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
"
p269_269,"They want to shut the Scottish Office.
"
p269_270,"They are never here.
"
p269_271,"The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
"
p269_272,"On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
"
p269_273,"It left me with a sadness.
"
p269_274,"Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
"
p269_275,"We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
"
p269_276,"But, in fact, the reverse is true.
"
p269_277,"They wanted the club to make money.
"
p269_278,"It's a way of life.
"
p269_279,"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
"
p269_280,"A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
"
p269_281,"He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
"
p269_282,"However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
"
p269_283,"In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
"
p269_284,"In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
"
p269_285,"It happens from time to time.
"
p269_286,"If not, he should go home.
"
p269_287,"They were too hard.
"
p269_288,"I saw it at a ruck.
"
p269_289,"I intended to look for another club on loan.
"
p269_290,"You've got to have both sides.
"
p269_291,"What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
"
p269_292,"It was a virus.
"
p269_293,"Who will perform?
"
p269_294,"It's like a high school play.
"
p269_295,"This is a national crisis.
"
p269_296,"I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
"
p269_297,"The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
"
p269_298,"Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
"
p269_299,"It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
"
p269_300,"It changed my life.
"
p269_301,"It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
"
p269_302,"Sunday's game was not a trial.

"
p269_304,"A new school will be built.

"
p269_306,"Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
"
p269_307,"I was the sheep.
"
p269_308,"Graeme was prepared.
"
p269_309,"However, the snow was welcomed by some.
"
p269_310,"But it's a subtle process.
"
p269_311,"The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
"
p269_312,"There is no openness.
"
p269_313,"They are wrong.
"
p269_314,"Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
"
p269_315,"Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
"
p269_316,"In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
"
p269_317,"It's just not funny!
"
p269_318,"It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
"
p269_319,"They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
"
p269_320,"The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
"
p269_321,"SCOTLAND has shown the way.
"
p269_322,"I did not name it.
"
p269_323,"The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
"
p269_324,"We have got no money to go anywhere.
"
p269_325,"This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
"
p269_326,"It's about my time as a guitarist.
"
p269_327,"I was rubbish.
"
p269_328,"We are a peaceful people.
"
p269_329,"The election is total confusion and chaos.
"
p269_330,"Kids are terrible.
"
p269_331,"Henman has been warned.
"
p269_332,"Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
"
p269_333,"The problems began a long time ago.
"
p269_334,"Referees are easy targets.
"
p269_335,"They had a confession.
"
p269_336,"In the old days, it was easy.
"
p269_337,"However, the groups denied the claims.
"
p269_338,"I came into this world with nothing.
"
p269_339,"That's the law of the land.
"
p269_340,"There was no time scale.
"
p269_341,"It is a strong case.
"
p269_342,"Is there a new way forward?
"
p269_343,"They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
"
p269_344,"The boat was fantastic.
"
p269_345,"I'd like to take the plunge.
"
p269_346,"Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
"
p269_347,"You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
"
p269_348,"It's been hard.
"
p269_349,"Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
"
p269_350,"It is a sign of hope.
"
p269_352,"It has moved on in the last week.
"
