p347_001,Please call Stella.
p347_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p347_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p347_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p347_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p347_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p347_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p347_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p347_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p347_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p347_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p347_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p347_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p347_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p347_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p347_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p347_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p347_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p347_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p347_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p347_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p347_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p347_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p347_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p347_025,A crucial moment has arrived.
p347_026,"We still have a long, long way to go."
p347_027,Some will be deployed on submarines.
p347_028,There are moments of silence.
p347_029,So now this series has had its day.
p347_030,Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p347_031,Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p347_032,It's a policy which has worked for us.
p347_033,"Locally, too, the MP is under fire."
p347_034,That didn't happen for two reasons.
p347_035,His views are hardly surprising.
p347_036,It is time for a new approach.
p347_037,"And look at the leading conductors, he says."
p347_038,We have nothing to say about that.
p347_039,We've tried every other way.
p347_040,I'll have to go out and impress.
p347_041,"Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland."
p347_043,He had a really frustrating time last year.
p347_044,It does make a big difference.
p347_045,How many cases have there been?
p347_046,"Peter, of course, refuses to conform."
p347_047,You can't give in to the vandals.
p347_048,The Old Firm are going nowhere.
p347_049,Everything was an effort.
p347_050,And does it even matter?
p347_051,George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p347_052,My parents are exhausted.
p347_053,"No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted."
p347_054,"Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory."
p347_055,"If he does not leave, he will be shot."
p347_056,My thoughts are with their families.
p347_057,It will come up here.
p347_058,"From our point of view, the player is free to leave."
p347_059,Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p347_060,It is a very special city.
p347_061,This is only the start of my season.
p347_062,The message is just not getting through.
p347_063,It sounded awfully like panic.
p347_064,I've taken to the hills.
p347_065,"This is a big, big win."
p347_066,The crowd was awesome.
p347_067,My game is in pretty good shape.
p347_068,We were given a break.
p347_069,He already had had complaints.
p347_070,How come it is so often unnoticed?
p347_071,I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p347_072,"Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help."
p347_073,They had not been handcuffed.
p347_074,I think we will join the single currency.
p347_075,Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p347_076,You have to rely on each other.
p347_077,One thing is certain.
p347_078,We cannot ask for them back.
p347_079,"It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one."
p347_080,No-one said anything to me.
p347_081,All of us do.
p347_082,That is in the public domain.
p347_083,The Hague is too good for him.
p347_084,"On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options."
p347_085,"In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed."
p347_086,It's a true story.
p347_087,This is a club on the rise.
p347_088,"John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say."
p347_089,Theatre is not a museum.
p347_090,It is a hangover effect.
p347_091,This is my life.
p347_092,"Subs not used, McCulloch."
p347_093,"Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain."
p347_094,The thing is to recognise that chance.
p347_095,We gave them the goal.
p347_096,They don't take you to mass graves.
p347_097,There was no option.
p347_098,What's it got to do with art?
p347_099,Could they perhaps be related?
p347_100,But who shot the president?
p347_101,We do not get that impression now.
p347_102,I'm looking forward to that.
p347_103,"It was not a beautiful game, was it?"
p347_104,Safety was also an issue.
p347_105,That's why he visited.
p347_106,I know a lot of people who don't.
p347_107,There was nobody on the roof.
p347_108,Clark is back on top form.
p347_109,"He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland."
p347_110,It needs somebody to give way.
p347_111,We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p347_112,It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p347_113,They are all Arabs.
p347_114,The days of empty promises are over.
p347_115,Henry was strong and talented.
p347_116,That is our unfinished business.

p347_118,Faces from the Eighties.
p347_119,Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p347_120,"Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding."
p347_121,"Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive."
p347_122,You can cope with it.
p347_123,"It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain."
p347_124,They will do their own thing.
p347_125,Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p347_126,We are in the business of selling tickets.
p347_127,It is just part of modern day life.
p347_128,A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p347_129,Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p347_130,Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p347_131,YOU thought it was a headache.
p347_132,All the people thought that we would die.
p347_133,It is never an easy game.
p347_134,This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p347_135,No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
p347_136,I don't want to come down.
p347_137,"However, it's good to turn the page."
p347_138,I thought it was quite good.
p347_139,He had reason to be pleased.
p347_140,It was important to win the singles.
p347_141,That is impressive by any standards.
p347_142,I felt we needed to bring that in.
p347_143,There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p347_144,"I'm thinking, what would be easier?"
p347_145,That alibi is now gone.
p347_146,But the cost to his health was enormous.
p347_147,Too many factors are now working against him.
p347_148,Is the war over?
p347_149,You do have a way out.
p347_150,"It is simple, really."
p347_151,I just wasn't very good.
p347_152,Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p347_153,But he is not using them.
p347_154,Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
p347_155,I certainly believe we can do it.
p347_156,They've got a sort of unwritten contract.
p347_157,It was a breathtaking moment.
p347_158,That's been our position all along.
p347_159,I was in jail for five years.
p347_160,We have not had a formal request.
p347_161,I never had a childhood.
p347_162,Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p347_163,We offered something different.
p347_164,We were very much a happy family.
p347_165,They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p347_166,"It is true, but it is only part of the issue."
p347_167,It's going to be epic.
p347_168,"Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes."
p347_169,It was large enough to fit the wall.
p347_170,She could easily have been killed.
p347_171,British officials said they could not say.
p347_172,"Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed."
p347_173,I never found my rhythm.
p347_174,I didn't mean to kill her.
p347_175,It is a job creation scheme.
p347_176,"In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot."
p347_177,We might be back next year.
p347_178,It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p347_179,The same goes for personnel.
p347_180,Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p347_181,"In fact, they should have scored three times."

p347_183,This area is perfect for children.
p347_184,The firm was down and almost out.
p347_185,I was chosen to do this.
p347_186,I learned a lot from that.
p347_187,I think we're very different.
p347_188,The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p347_189,There was an element of jealousy.
p347_190,Glasgow then took control.
p347_191,"Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey."
p347_192,My ambitions are still with football.
p347_193,That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p347_194,"Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good."
p347_195,Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p347_196,We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p347_197,"Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair."
p347_198,Our approach will be different.
p347_199,It's not right of Labour.
p347_200,It is legally binding.
p347_201,We went straight into the bedroom.
p347_202,Before the games it was pretty open.
p347_203,But you can go beyond that condition.
p347_204,He is only now regaining his confidence.
p347_205,Singing has gone out of fashion.
p347_206,He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p347_207,"Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought."
p347_208,Who can tell?
p347_209,"However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter."
p347_210,They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
p347_211,My attitude is exactly the same as before.
p347_212,I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p347_213,Or some thought that they have.
p347_214,He has lost confidence and weight.
p347_215,That was moving the goalposts.
p347_216,This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p347_217,A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
p347_218,You'll get on like a house on fire.
p347_219,Two and a half million people have died.
p347_220,It could not be too high.
p347_221,Or so it would appear.
p347_222,Do not forget about Monaco.
p347_223,I hope they understand that.
p347_224,You can never tell.
p347_225,But Annika is just amazing.
p347_226,Our job is to change that.
p347_227,She will also get a pay rise.
p347_228,The damage has been done.
p347_229,It is time for a more honest approach.
p347_230,That's the National Grid.
p347_231,"That is very, very bad news for our nation."
p347_232,"Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start."
p347_233,It is a big time for me.
p347_234,There were two things going on at once.
p347_235,He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p347_236,It is a cause for concern.
p347_237,Stalkers are capable of killing.
p347_238,That is the key message.
p347_239,It ignores the future.
p347_240,This is the subway.
p347_241,Altman has every right to be bitter.
p347_242,What's the rush?
p347_243,Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p347_244,He's in with the furniture.
p347_245,Do not go into government buildings.
p347_246,There is only one caveat.
p347_247,We are still getting signals.
p347_248,"What's it got to do with them, anyway?"
p347_249,I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p347_250,Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p347_251,Everyone can be bought.
p347_252,There are a few changes.
p347_253,You're not going to get hurt.
p347_254,THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p347_255,The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p347_256,THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p347_257,I heard some of his remarks.
p347_258,I am a little bit tired.
p347_259,Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p347_260,I was just overwhelmed.
p347_261,It had been in place since last July.
p347_262,I have just got to get back.
p347_263,"In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves."
p347_264,Players want to know what is on offer.
p347_265,"Well, when did he ever refuse?"
p347_266,"We will have to see, but it makes you think."
p347_267,I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p347_268,The singer's condition was not specified.
p347_269,How much of a cop out is that?
p347_270,The whole region is in shock.
p347_271,It was a journey into a new life.
p347_272,It will be the final push.
p347_273,"Life, as many people know it, in other words."
p347_274,You were the kidnappers.
p347_275,It is a very interesting subject.
p347_276,"Arguably, they have already done it."
p347_277,She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
p347_278,Raymond was always on the outside.
p347_279,The women were on their way home yesterday.
p347_280,I could feel the blood on my face.
p347_281,I am a committed European.
p347_282,There are no plans to change this.
p347_283,The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p347_284,It's in the eyes.
p347_285,Working with him is like working with myself.
p347_286,It is just too long since the war.
p347_287,She didn't tell us anything new.
p347_288,I mean it happens.
p347_289,My wife is totally behind me on this.
p347_290,Debbie Harry was cool.
p347_291,Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p347_292,Receiving this medal is an honour.
p347_293,"Sub Not Used, McCulloch."
p347_294,"Six months later, they returned to Scotland."
p347_295,It is typical of me.
p347_296,Raised the way you want it.
p347_297,"However, consumers may take a different view."
p347_298,I know you went back this morning.
p347_299,They played it like a cup final.
p347_300,This has a number of benefits.
p347_301,I will carry on.
p347_302,I think it is a great shame.
p347_303,A review of the decision is being sought.
p347_304,"It will be about commitment, not compliance."
p347_305,The chief constable is right.
p347_306,And we were right.
p347_307,That is where the club has gone wrong.
p347_308,A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p347_309,Surely it can do better than that?
p347_310,It's my favourite place to hang out.
p347_311,I think that could work to our advantage.
p347_312,"I, like an idiot, agreed."
p347_313,Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p347_314,He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p347_315,We hope this scheme will change that.
p347_316,I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
p347_317,The red card was okay.
p347_318,The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p347_319,"Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry."
p347_320,"I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue."
p347_321,"However, the referee was not in the giving vein."
p347_322,I was doing well at the hustings.
p347_323,"But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding."
p347_324,This is my music.
p347_325,I haven't won the world title.
p347_326,"After his birthday, Scott was very upset."
p347_327,It's fantastic to have finally won.
p347_328,But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p347_329,There is no date on this document.
p347_330,And now he tells us.
p347_331,I am not changing my event.
p347_332,I know nothing about that.
p347_333,Ferguson did not hesitate.
p347_334,That is as it may be.
p347_335,"They did, too, but it didn't matter by then."
p347_336,This is the start of a new campaign.
p347_337,Eleven events are required.
p347_338,It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p347_339,You encourage them - you can do it.
p347_340,The winner will be announced by early summer.
p347_341,I always said No.
p347_342,Britain is a peaceful nation.
p347_343,Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
p347_344,It is very much a matter for them.
p347_345,Our future was his future.
p347_346,His name is Michael Owen.
p347_347,It has made a difference.
p347_348,He's got a great chance of making it.
p347_349,Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
p347_350,"Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round."
p347_351,So now you know.
p347_352,"But, at the same time, they made you think about life."
p347_353,It's a very special unit.
p347_354,We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p347_355,I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p347_356,"Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised."
p347_357,"By social devices, the two groups are coming together."
p347_358,Smith has not let him down.
p347_359,Which he can do.
p347_360,"No, it's actually in a block of flats."
p347_361,They were that poor.
p347_362,And we're talking Big Money.
p347_363,His silence on the issue is interesting.
p347_364,I was a little surprised.
p347_365,It was a bit like having children.
p347_366,"With Pierre, you can never be sure."
p347_367,They believed it worked.
p347_368,I'm really proud of my young players.
p347_369,"As it happened, it was much more than that."
p347_370,It's an internal matter.
p347_371,They should feel ashamed.
p347_372,You realise what this means?
p347_373,We're delighted about the vote.
p347_374,They were only there for three weeks.
p347_375,I'm just looking to take my chances.
p347_376,Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p347_377,It is just completely erased.
p347_378,"To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath."
p347_379,"It's been like that for ages, according to the guys."
p347_380,It's not just for classical music.
p347_381,This must be kept in total perspective.
p347_382,Election results are expected soon.
p347_383,All of the names are familiar to me.
p347_384,"There are moments of honesty, too."
p347_385,They didn't find anything.
p347_386,Is that where we are?
p347_387,We used to keep our business rates.
p347_388,"It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult."
p347_389,I suspect that it will.
p347_390,But there's no eye contact.
p347_391,There was no energy behind it.
p347_392,"They could take the result away from them, couldn't they."
p347_393,"Even for a British Open, this is different."
p347_394,I took a minibus into town.
p347_395,They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
p347_396,Completion is expected by October the following year.
p347_397,It is not a wish list.
p347_398,Some of the players have not progressed.
p347_399,They were both very brave.
p347_400,There is no margin for error.
p347_401,Why should we even be asked to share?
p347_402,It was not a foul.
p347_403,I get very excited by that.
p347_404,The members have clearly spoken.
p347_405,"In the end, it will mean an awful lot."
p347_406,I believe in God.
p347_407,Which means it matters.
p347_408,There is great potential on this river.
p347_409,We can't win a big game.
p347_410,It was a stunning strike.
p347_411,"This is a one-year deal, but who knows?"
p347_412,She said he showed no remorse.
p347_413,We are going through difficult times.
