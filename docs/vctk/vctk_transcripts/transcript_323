p323_001,Please call Stella.
p323_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p323_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p323_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p323_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p323_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p323_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p323_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p323_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p323_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p323_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p323_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p323_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p323_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p323_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p323_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p323_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p323_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p323_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p323_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p323_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p323_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p323_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p323_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p323_025,We've made a couple of albums.
p323_026,Film music was never the same again.
p323_027,It was a deeply moving musical experience.
p323_028,Now it is much easier.
p323_029,"However, on the other hand, in principle it is plainly wrong."
p323_030,This is the best way to do it.
p323_031,Its role is not to interfere.
p323_032,Leisure centres were also affected.
p323_033,Something happened on that island.
p323_034,"Meantime, the department is proposing structural changes."
p323_035,"Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister."
p323_036,It is misleading to compare the two.
p323_037,They discussed how he might get involved.
p323_038,And this perception might find an unlikely supporter.
p323_039,And it had two seats.
p323_040,They were not up to speed.
p323_041,We know the quality of life goes up.
p323_042,What is next?
p323_043,Now they have found out the truth.
p323_044,We've still got a say in this.
p323_045,The first was excluding Sinn Fein.
p323_046,Horses are drawn by ballot.
p323_047,We have our supporters and our enemies.
p323_048,"Mackie was at home, unable to watch."
p323_049,"So, what's it about?"
p323_050,We have been let down by these people.
p323_051,What's it for?
p323_052,Nor does he have any desire to be.
p323_053,How well did they get on?
p323_054,I don't think it is a drawback.
p323_055,"He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth."
p323_056,They may have been murdered.
p323_057,However this weekend it will be different.
p323_058,"We didn't try hard enough, that is all."
p323_059,It also condemned the suicide bombers.
p323_060,I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p323_061,It is very difficult.
p323_062,This is the place to play football.
p323_063,But it was a great decision he joked.
p323_064,Then they killed another three.
p323_065,What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p323_066,The six others were injured.
p323_067,Most of the others were in their twenties.
p323_068,We were beaten by the better team today.
p323_069,You need a long-term strategy in football.

p323_078,The protest will go ahead as planned.
p323_079,The punishment was swift.
p323_080,Who will run the bigger show?
p323_081,"General, You didn't get a modified."
p323_082,"It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership."
p323_083,These things just happen.
p323_084,"And, within itself, it is visionary."
p323_085,Are you up for business?
p323_086,It's an interesting debate to get going.
p323_087,Who does he think will win?
p323_088,I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
p323_089,An announcement will follow in due course.
p323_090,You are not in any kind of trouble.
p323_091,It also makes for interesting viewing.
p323_092,Will they fall out?
p323_093,Scotland came very close in the second Test.
p323_094,He was not able to talk to us.
p323_095,"Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights."
p323_096,There is no conflict of interest.
p323_097,They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p323_098,They are not suitable.
p323_099,It does seem a mystery.

p323_120,We have a high quality product.
p323_121,A Scotsman has to defend his castle.

p323_127,I would never say anything against her.

p323_130,I see no need for change.
p323_131,We are in a very strong position.
p323_132,This will have no effect on the championship.
p323_133,We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
p323_134,It was no more than they deserved.
p323_135,Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p323_136,I'm just glad that no-one was hurt.
p323_137,Everything was a dead end.
p323_138,"It's been a long, long journey."
p323_139,I can give no comment.

p323_155,The encounter was to change his life.
p323_156,They should not have behaved in that way.
p323_157,I've never seen them down here.
p323_158,The motive for the shooting was not known.
p323_159,I got off to a great start.
p323_160,It's the best of both worlds.
p323_161,That is our unfinished business.
p323_162,I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p323_163,"It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention."
p323_164,But it was to no avail.
p323_165,"We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today."
p323_166,There are so many people to thank.
p323_167,Nato has left them with no other option.

p323_236,Anything can happen - at any moment.
p323_237,He predicted the contest would be very close.

p323_239,My life would be a lot less restrictive.
p323_240,The key issue for us is public safety.
p323_241,Nobody wants to stop people enjoying themselves.
p323_242,I went home and wrote about it.
