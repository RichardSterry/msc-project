p229_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p229_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p229_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p229_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p229_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p229_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p229_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p229_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p229_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p229_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p229_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p229_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p229_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p229_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p229_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p229_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p229_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p229_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p229_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p229_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p229_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p229_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p229_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p229_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p229_025,"Johnson was pretty low.
"
p229_026,"He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
"
p229_027,"It's nice to hear.
"
p229_028,"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
"
p229_029,"I have a theory.
"
p229_030,"It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
"
p229_031,"So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
"
p229_032,"Because we do not need it.
"
p229_033,"And we have a singer.
"
p229_034,"A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
"
p229_035,"It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
"
p229_036,"I'd like to continue that record.
"
p229_037,"However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
"
p229_038,"In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
"
p229_039,"They're just different.
"
p229_040,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p229_041,"It is not for any other purpose.
"
p229_042,"He did not know his daughter.
"
p229_043,"People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
"
p229_044,"I was scared.
"
p229_045,"It will come all right.
"
p229_046,"But it took a lot of bottle.
"
p229_047,"But it is all by design.
"
p229_048,"I am just going to go for it.
"
p229_050,"We need to chat.
"
p229_051,"It is difficult for Ali.
"
p229_052,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p229_053,"A recording contract is on the horizon.
"
p229_054,"Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
"
p229_055,"It has been a horrible, horrible time.
"
p229_056,"We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
"
p229_057,"She's a spy !
"
p229_058,"What was the main difference ?
"
p229_059,"My mother is a widow.
"
p229_060,"And a film maker was born.
"
p229_061,"Art is extra.
"
p229_062,"Scotland had great assets.
"
p229_063,"I've spent a lot of time on buses.
"
p229_064,"We should have known.
"
p229_065,"It is like a river running by my home.
"
p229_066,"Try to save us.
"
p229_067,"That was the easy election.
"
p229_068,"I was as strong as a horse.
"
p229_069,"Ferguson should take note.
"
p229_070,"The girls are so lucky to be alive.
"
p229_071,"Neither it is.
"
p229_072,"She died in hospital two hours later.
"
p229_073,"It was chaotic.
"
p229_074,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p229_075,"It works for us.
"
p229_076,"I've not thought about it.
"
p229_077,"Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
"
p229_078,"Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
"
p229_079,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p229_080,"That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
"
p229_081,"He seems to be pleased with the picture.
"
p229_082,"Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
"
p229_083,"Someone who cares
"
p229_084,"He can do everything.
"
p229_085,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p229_086,"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
"
p229_087,"Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
"
p229_088,"They lived for their children.
"
p229_089,"It is a lifeline.
"
p229_090,"However, it did not end that way.
"
p229_091,"We must look forward.
"
p229_092,"It is an old family habit.
"
p229_093,"Well, the big day has arrived.
"
p229_094,"I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
"
p229_095,"Until you hit the big games.
"
p229_096,"The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
"
p229_097,"The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
"
p229_098,"She's got to say something.
"
p229_099,"He is hungry for success and I am the same.
"
p229_100,"They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
"
p229_101,"She has so much to offer.
"
p229_102,"The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
"
p229_103,"It is a good day for the coalition.
"
p229_104,"We work on the same level.
"
p229_105,"They were outside the circle.
"
p229_106,"Two of the team became ill.
"
p229_108,"I didn't play well last year.
"
p229_109,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p229_110,"I'm not depressed.
"
p229_111,"It is normal.
"
p229_112,"He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
"
p229_113,"I don't have many friends.
"
p229_114,"He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
"
p229_115,"I came to complete.
"
p229_116,"I was angry.
"
p229_117,"They were behind the wheel.
"
p229_118,"The fire was above the hole.
"
p229_119,"It's not fair.
"
p229_120,"We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
"
p229_121,"On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
"
p229_122,"Maybe this battle has been.
"
p229_123,"I'm delighted about that.
"
p229_124,"I joined a group.
"
p229_125,"It is rubbish.
"
p229_126,"Who would be a referee ?
"
p229_127,"It was my own fault and I lost a lot of belief.
"
p229_128,"The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
"
p229_129,"An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
"
p229_130,"Here, again, they were denied a voice.
"
p229_131,"There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
"
p229_132,"It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
"
p229_133,"She really suffered for her art.
"
p229_134,"Next season for every manager is a long time away.
"
p229_135,"It's an amazing landscape !
"
p229_136,"So the European elections are extremely important.
"
p229_137,"He is slightly confused.
"
p229_138,"Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
"
p229_139,"If not, a deal could take many months.
"
p229_140,"They took a risk.
"
p229_141,"Government will intervene.
"
p229_142,"What will happen then ?
"
p229_143,"We never said that we would walk through the third division.
"
p229_144,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p229_145,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p229_146,"I was the last man to touch the ball.
"
p229_147,"Nobody in the world can get away from him.
"
p229_148,"Three penalties were given.
"
p229_149,"In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
"
p229_150,"We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
"
p229_151,"Who would be right ?
"
p229_152,"We just had a go.
"
p229_153,"He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
"
p229_154,"Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
"
p229_155,"He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
"
p229_156,"Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
"
p229_157,"It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
"
p229_158,"The home side didn't stand a chance.
"
p229_159,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p229_160,"Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
"
p229_161,"We also enjoyed a lot of support.
"
p229_162,"It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
"
p229_163,"It was by the numbers.
"
p229_164,"I knew he was good.
"
p229_165,"He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
"
p229_166,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p229_167,"Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
"
p229_168,"Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
"
p229_169,"Was this element always there ?
"
p229_170,"Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
"
p229_171,"A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
"
p229_172,"I will tell you.
"
p229_173,"A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
"
p229_174,"It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
"
p229_175,"Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
"
p229_176,"We have to move forward.
"
p229_177,"It's that sort of night.
"
p229_178,"Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
"
p229_179,"It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
"
p229_180,"The post will be unpaid.
"
p229_181,"Does that put pressure on us ?
"
p229_182,"It is a memorial.
"
p229_183,"It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
"
p229_184,"They thought they had found a home.
"
p229_185,"One season, they might do well.
"
p229_186,"Is Saddam a threat ?
"
p229_187,"The home was now under new management.
"
p229_188,"He asked me in a tolerance zone.
"
p229_189,"The hotel was now for sale.
"
p229_190,"I drove the ball well.
"
p229_191,"It is the whole package.
"
p229_192,"I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
"
p229_193,"We knew nothing about it.
"
p229_194,"It is minute.
"
p229_195,"Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
"
p229_196,"Four policemen were wounded.
"
p229_197,"What has caused the demise of singing ?
"
p229_198,"Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
"
p229_199,"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
"
p229_200,"I've got good news and bad news for you.
"
p229_201,"We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
"
p229_202,"People will ask about us.
"
p229_203,"The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
"
p229_204,"Last night was a key episode.
"
p229_205,"Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
"
p229_206,"It wasn't to be.
"
p229_207,"I wanted to put myself on the line.
"
p229_209,"I came home by ambulance.
"
p229_210,"It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
"
p229_211,"It's the same old story.
"
p229_212,"But we are not immune to the problem.
"
p229_213,"He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
"
p229_214,"The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
"
p229_215,"The procedures were not in place.
"
p229_216,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p229_217,"We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
"
p229_218,"After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
"
p229_219,"Saddam Hussein is a devil.
"
p229_220,"That is an important part of our role.
"
p229_221,"She should not be blamed.
"
p229_222,"We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
"
p229_223,"I am delighted for Simon.
"
p229_224,"I had decided to quit the show.
"
p229_225,"The FBI could become involved.
"
p229_226,"However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
"
p229_227,"For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
"
p229_228,"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
"
p229_229,"The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
"
p229_230,"Who was on the panel ?
"
p229_231,"We've got the bronze.
"
p229_232,"Saturday is gone.
"
p229_233,"At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
"
p229_234,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p229_235,"The boy is no longer with us.
"
p229_236,"The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
"
p229_237,"The track is currently covered in snow.
"
p229_238,"I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
"
p229_239,"You should always be able to get out in some direction.
"
p229_240,"We are so proud.
"
p229_241,"We were a load of rubbish.
"
p229_242,"The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
"
p229_243,"It's an idea.
"
p229_244,"On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
"
p229_245,"The sanctions are about collective punishment.
"
p229_246,"We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
"
p229_247,"The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
"
p229_248,"The problem in Norway is outside the National.
"
p229_249,"The letters are going out today.
"
p229_250,"It's only fair.
"
p229_251,"Chambers said he would accept the place.
"
p229_252,"Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
"
p229_253,"It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
"
p229_254,"It was a hit.
"
p229_255,"A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
"
p229_256,"This year I understood.
"
p229_257,"He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
"
p229_258,"Kirkwood was arrested.
"
p229_259,"This is a big club.
"
p229_260,"That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
"
p229_261,"I was happily surprised.
"
p229_262,"They must play for each other.
"
p229_263,"The pensioners did not want to know.
"
p229_264,"He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
"
p229_265,"Today we can say that a new era has begun.
"
p229_266,"That is highly unfair.
"
p229_267,"The warning is timely.
"
p229_268,"Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
"
p229_269,"That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
"
p229_270,"They are never here.
"
p229_271,"I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
"
p229_272,"He was also married with two children.
"
p229_273,"It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
"
p229_274,"We're in shock.
"
p229_275,"Our objective is to tackle poverty.
"
p229_277,"It's a way of life.
"
p229_278,"She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
"
p229_279,"He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
"
p229_280,"I am an estate agent.
"
p229_281,"People have no choice.
"
p229_282,"They were on holiday in Egypt.
"
p229_283,"It was a privilege to work for him.
"
p229_284,"In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
"
p229_285,"If not, he should go home.
"
p229_286,"For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
"
p229_287,"I saw it at a ruck.
"
p229_288,"I felt like I was a child.
"
p229_289,"What would be the timetable for withdrawal ?
"
p229_290,"The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
"
p229_292,"We have other options.
"
p229_293,"I do not think this family will ever get over this.
"
p229_294,"It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
"
p229_295,"These figures are truly awful.
"
p229_296,"Sunday's game was not a trial.
"
p229_297,"Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
"
p229_298,"The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
"
p229_300,"I was brought up in a mining background.
"
p229_301,"I thought it was my only chance.
"
p229_302,"Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
"
p229_303,"The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
"
p229_304,"The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
"
p229_305,"There is no openness.
"
p229_306,"This is a war over our home.
"
p229_307,"In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
"
p229_308,"It's just not funny !
"
p229_309,"It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
"
p229_310,"The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
"
p229_311,"You are the glory.
"
p229_312,"However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
"
p229_313,"Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
"
p229_314,"It's certainly different.
"
p229_315,"O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
"
p229_316,"This is the culture change in medicine.
"
p229_318,"It's about my time as a guitarist.
"
p229_319,"There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
"
p229_320,"It's not even finished.
"
p229_322,"It should be equal.
"
p229_323,"Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
"
p229_324,"We are very strongly behind the bid.
"
p229_325,"In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
"
p229_326,"I am very happy to be here.
"
p229_328,"It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
"
p229_329,"On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
"
p229_330,"It could have gone either way.
"
p229_331,"He was then replaced by Ross.
"
p229_332,"I'd like to take the plunge.
"
p229_333,"She did not attend the courtroom.
"
p229_334,"It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
"
p229_335,"He told the court.
"
p229_336,"The team for the first game could be this one.
"
p229_337,"They haven't got a hope.
"
p229_338,"It has moved on in the last week.
"
p229_339,"Gaelic provision continued to be good.
"
p229_340,"He did a good job.
"
p229_341,"I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
"
p229_342,"Today she has been released.
"
p229_343,"These days are long gone.
"
p229_344,"They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
"
p229_345,"But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
"
p229_346,"Indeed, it was magical.
"
p229_347,"I've got no secret.
"
p229_348,"Look at the witnesses.
"
p229_349,"The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
"
p229_350,"I'm very lucky.
"
p229_351,"They may yet have the last laugh.
"
p229_352,"Everything was an effort.
"
p229_353,"This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
"
p229_354,"Like his acting, it was an accident.
"
