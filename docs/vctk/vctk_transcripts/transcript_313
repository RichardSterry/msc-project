p313_001,Please call Stella.
p313_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p313_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p313_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p313_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p313_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p313_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p313_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p313_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p313_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p313_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p313_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p313_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p313_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p313_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p313_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p313_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p313_018,Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p313_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p313_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p313_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the sizes of the drops increases."
p313_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
p313_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p313_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p313_025,They will be dealt with.
p313_026,It is never an easy game.
p313_027,This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p313_028,I intend to raise the matter there.
p313_029,"However, it's good to turn the page."
p313_030,We have to put this behind us.
p313_031,I thought it was quite good.
p313_032,It was important to win the singles.
p313_033,This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p313_034,That is impressive by any standards.
p313_035,We are doing very well as we are.
p313_036,"The waiting is over, well almost."
p313_037,"This was the performance, and the result they needed."
p313_038,"I'm not allowed to say that, of course."
p313_039,It helped me to get noticed.
p313_040,They hit me in the head.
p313_041,But he is not using them.
p313_042,"That, though, was just the start of it."
p313_043,We are not moving in.
p313_044,We have not had a formal request.
p313_045,I never had a childhood.
p313_046,Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p313_047,We offered something different.
p313_048,We were very much a happy family.
p313_049,He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p313_050,My brother's buried under there.
p313_051,Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p313_052,What were they?
p313_053,It was large enough to fit the wall.
p313_054,He will be judged by his actions.
p313_055,Her role in it was small.
p313_056,I've really noticed that this week.
p313_057,We might be back next year.
p313_058,In a way he was.
p313_059,It's back to how it used to be.
p313_060,It is not a standing army.
p313_061,The firm was down and almost out.
p313_062,They said they were only young men.
p313_063,I was chosen to do this.
p313_064,I learned a lot from that.
p313_065,The house was so well alight.
p313_066,He got his degree.
p313_067,Sandy was very active.
p313_068,"However, there is great potential in this right."
p313_069,We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p313_070,I'm confident of the outcome this week.
p313_071,There were no formal announcements.
p313_072,Before the games it was pretty open.
p313_073,It really has left the town in shock.
p313_074,But you can go beyond that condition.
p313_075,I'm so worried about the roads.
p313_076,This was much worse.
p313_077,He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p313_078,We are confident of taking that back.
p313_079,They must be kept on the ground.
p313_080,Did they give any good advice?
p313_081,Who wants to be a millionaire?
p313_082,This does not help.
p313_083,I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p313_084,That's why the ministers resigned.
p313_085,He has lost confidence and weight.
p313_086,This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p313_087,Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p313_088,This could be her way forward.
p313_089,This gives us a lot of practice.
p313_090,The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p313_091,"It's a very, very special day."
p313_092,The crucial strike was yet to come.
p313_093,There's also the point.
p313_094,It was forced to divert.
p313_095,"Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre."
p313_096,That's the National Grid.
p313_097,But Allen is deadly serious.
p313_098,Peter doesn't want to leave.
p313_099,He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p313_100,They've just got to believe in themselves.
p313_101,This is my personal assessment.
p313_102,There was no trouble at all.
p313_103,"Although, you never know."
p313_104,We shall be victorious.
p313_105,The quality of work is very impressive.
p313_106,"However, he added there were signs of progress."
p313_107,"Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer."
p313_108,I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p313_109,Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p313_110,I took the gun.
p313_111,It's just one of those things.
p313_112,A web site is planned for November.
p313_113,We played so well at times.
p313_114,I was very fortunate.
p313_115,Such a policy would be a disaster.
p313_116,We act because we must.
p313_117,They will be destroyed.
p313_118,We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p313_119,O Neill is reputed to have replied.
p313_120,The Tory party will last.
p313_121,It was a journey into a new life.
p313_122,It's a way of making a mark.
p313_123,There is a great carry over value.
p313_124,"Life, as many people know it, in other words."
p313_125,"I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes."
p313_126,What's the point?
p313_127,Why is this?
p313_128,What has changed since then?
p313_129,Raymond was always on the outside.
p313_130,We need to make more inquiries about that.
p313_131,I'd love to be at the World Cup.
p313_132,He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
p313_133,I'm sorry to hear this news.
p313_134,"At some point, the bill will be presented."
p313_135,I mean it happens.
p313_136,This week is a perfect example.
p313_137,This performance has given my confidence a boost.
p313_138,Receiving this medal is an honour.
p313_139,"Sub Not Used, McCulloch."
p313_140,But every two minutes it was exploding.
p313_141,That sort of thing is long gone.
p313_142,It's typical of me.
p313_143,"However, consumers may take a different view."
p313_144,They played it like a cup final.
p313_145,"However, it's not all bad news for women."
p313_146,But the championship is not over yet.
p313_147,We haven't found out anything different.
p313_148,A review of the decision is being sought.
p313_149,"It will be about commitment, not compliance."
p313_150,"Still, in the end, it was a fair result."
p313_151,Surely it can do better than that?
p313_152,I am ashamed of them.
p313_153,"Glasgow, however, did not get a mention."
p313_154,The salary changes are long overdue.
p313_155,"I, like an idiot, agreed."
p313_156,"If so, we want to hear from them."
p313_157,I'm not blaming audiences.
p313_158,Who was on the panel?
p313_159,They may differ on other issues.
p313_160,He'd never run the distance before.
p313_161,I can make one further announcement.
p313_162,The General Election is all to play for.
p313_163,It was a fiery game.
p313_164,Agents and coaches must be paid.
p313_165,Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p313_166,"Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then."
p313_167,It will not be easy for him.
p313_168,This one is a special case.
p313_169,But what are the songs about?
p313_170,There is a simmering anger out there.
p313_171,The ministers are now to make their decision.
p313_172,That is not a position they enjoy.
p313_173,The stadium was full.
p313_174,Dewar is the medium.
p313_175,It was that kind of night.
p313_176,It is very much a matter for them.
p313_177,Perhaps it is jealousy.
p313_178,Any error is severely punished.
p313_179,He's got a great chance of making it.
p313_180,We won't do that.
p313_181,I hope we do.
p313_182,From now on there is no hiding place.
p313_183,I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p313_184,He quit in October.
p313_185,The United Nations must act.
p313_186,Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
p313_187,Her daughter is getting married.
p313_188,His manager blamed the referee.
p313_189,They were that poor.
p313_190,Patients will be partners in decision making.
p313_191,We have understood the problems for some time.
p313_192,Stan is a vital part of our future.
p313_193,All these things have an impact.
p313_194,That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p313_195,They believed it worked.
p313_196,"After that, though, we're still waiting to see."
p313_197,They should feel ashamed.
p313_198,This is a really serious issue.
p313_199,So they will settle again.
p313_200,How do we get more people in?
p313_201,I'm just looking to take my chances.
p313_202,It looks as though there is no chance.
p313_203,This is not a European Army.
p313_204,Election results are expected soon.
p313_205,So she told him.
p313_206,A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p313_207,"There are moments of honesty, too."
p313_208,It was good to score the goal today.
p313_209,The night is young.
p313_210,"Sadly, too, many of them are similar."
p313_211,I suspect that it will.
p313_212,But there's no eye contact.
p313_213,The squad will be the same for France.
p313_214,"We are a party for people, not against people."
p313_215,Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p313_216,We're still paying the price for that.
p313_217,"He did his best, but it wasn't good enough."
p313_218,It's not a wish list.
p313_219,"He's very, very lucky to be alive."
p313_220,Some of the players have not progressed.
p313_221,"It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident."
p313_222,"If not, he should go home."
p313_223,"We remain committed to it, as does the government."
p313_224,There is no margin for error.
p313_225,This was not an easy meeting for me.
p313_226,"From our point of view, it's the right time."
p313_227,That figure will always remain with me.
p313_228,And then a funny thing happened.
p313_229,It doesn't take much.
p313_230,She asked us a lot of questions.
p313_231,It was a stunning strike.
p313_232,It is a technique.
p313_233,They hold on for many years.
p313_234,Is it the shape of things to come?
p313_235,My body is exhausted.
p313_236,Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p313_237,We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
p313_238,There is nothing to fear.
p313_239,I was an athlete.
p313_240,Life was like a timetable.
p313_241,World leaders expressed their sympathy.
p313_242,I tried to push him away.
p313_243,It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p313_244,This was done by the council staff.
p313_245,The truth is otherwise.
p313_246,We haven't come out of this very well.
p313_247,I wanted to put myself on the line.
p313_248,I thought they could have made the gesture.
p313_249,We should be rewarded for producing.
p313_250,The bottom line is that this must stop.
p313_251,"Which, in effect, it is."
p313_252,The man became a reporter.
p313_253,It is a memorial.
p313_254,We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p313_255,Our people are paying high prices.
p313_256,The reason is partly because of tradition.
p313_257,Nor is it likely to do so.
p313_258,Or so everyone believed.
p313_259,Perhaps we should do the same.
p313_260,I read it every year.
p313_261,He was in contention almost every week.
p313_262,Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p313_263,It's up to Ann.
p313_264,We are playing them at their own game.
p313_265,By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p313_266,I had trouble with the producers.
p313_267,"So, it took me back to boarding school."
p313_268,They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p313_269,The conference is the first test.
p313_270,That's what we're trying to achieve.
p313_271,I expect a rapid response.
p313_272,There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p313_273,There is no more money.
p313_274,My mother is a widow.
p313_275,The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p313_276,There have been different reports from different people.
p313_277,It's an absolute disgrace.
p313_278,Something was plainly wrong.
p313_279,Why should he go anywhere?
p313_280,One thing is sure.
p313_281,It was a foolhardy decision.
p313_282,I'm confident we can do that.
p313_283,Funding needs to be long term.
p313_284,It's funny how it comes and goes.
p313_285,I would never even consider it.
p313_286,We're talking about the outskirts of London.
p313_287,The end result is precisely the same.
p313_288,We have it on video.
p313_289,I'm not a threat to coaches.
p313_290,"Painful, but only because it's true."
p313_291,It's never over until it's over.
p313_292,"Colonel, About this committee that is coming."
p313_293,"This year, it was a little different."
p313_294,"That, though, is to miss the point."
p313_295,We gave them the goal.
p313_296,Is being naturally funny enough?
p313_297,What's the point of staying sober?
p313_298,We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p313_299,The incident is being taken seriously.
p313_300,"So what's the shape, and what's the detail?"
p313_301,"They were going through the motions, but that's about all."
p313_302,I can feel the sound inside.
p313_303,I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p313_304,I'm not a fan of books.
p313_305,SO now we know the secret.
p313_306,It may well have been.
p313_307,I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p313_308,It was a simple question.
p313_309,I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
p313_310,And we've beaten them before.
p313_311,Could you put it in writing?
p313_312,I'm not a paedophile.
p313_313,Some of their movement was excellent.
p313_314,But they had to be paid for.
p313_315,The odds are that it will.
p313_316,But then they scored their fourth.
p313_317,They deserve a lot of credit.
p313_318,That's the position that the MoD has adopted.
p313_319,Why is that?
p313_320,Then came the crunch.
p313_321,But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p313_322,But will they fall in love?
p313_323,As if they ever stopped.
p313_324,The referee had a shocking game.
p313_325,Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p313_326,For a few years we had good fun.
p313_327,Medical staff are with them at the moment.
p313_328,It went on to become an annual event.
p313_329,This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p313_330,We are now in an election period.
p313_331,Everyone's too upset to comment.
p313_332,Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p313_333,But when we do it is great.
p313_334,She has nothing to say to journalists.
p313_335,I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p313_336,He pleaded for caution.
p313_339,I can't believe the buzz.
p313_340,I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p313_341,The picture is the same across Scotland.
p313_342,"When it comes down to it, this is a job."
p313_343,"It's no less intriguing, however."
p313_344,It's a question of perception.
p313_345,Staff have been informed.
p313_346,My heart is not so sure.
p313_347,This morning was very quiet.
p313_348,"On reflection, it was really quite exciting."
p313_349,It's been handled entirely properly.
p313_350,I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p313_351,That might help a bit.
p313_352,Two others were also seriously injured.
p313_353,He was made redundant in February of last year.
p313_354,"Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots."
p313_355,"Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United."
p313_356,You've obviously got an answer to it.
p313_357,It seems very odd.
p313_358,Closure is not one of them.
p313_359,The hotel was huge.
p313_360,A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p313_361,"Well, you can have a tree."
p313_362,It was the same at Twickenham.
p313_363,This is an internal matter.
p313_364,I'm amazed at what he's done.
p313_365,They took a risk.
p313_366,The idea was presented to me.
p313_367,The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p313_368,He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p313_369,His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p313_370,The hearing was fair.
p313_371,I see it as my job.
p313_372,This was not a summit about the euro.
p313_373,Frank Warren is a great man.
p313_374,I'm a little bit tired.
p313_375,That was never their agenda.
p313_376,She died at her home.
p313_377,She's currently in foster care.
p313_378,That's the only thing that matters.
p313_379,I enjoy the creative process.
p313_380,They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p313_381,"It is, however, an unlikely outcome."
p313_382,"As it was a double, it was pretty expensive."
p313_383,"It's always the same, isn't it?"
p313_384,We have been preparing all year.
p313_385,We could learn a lot from them.
p313_386,I can't wait for the outdoors.
p313_387,"Sure, we have problems."
p313_388,I was released after six days.
p313_389,That time is not far away.
p313_390,I may think about performing it.
p313_391,There are a number of possible outcomes.
p313_392,We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p313_393,This is the last thing we ever expected.
p313_394,You can't go back and change things.
p313_395,It's time to fight a decisive battle.
p313_396,"Of course, it is a tough assignment."
p313_397,"Instead, it's back to the drawing board."
p313_398,He says it often enough.
p313_399,"Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good."
p313_400,His primary residence is Scotland.
p313_401,I found that much more challenging.
p313_402,This fight is not going to go away.
p313_403,It would have been very easily done.
p313_404,I will never manage another Scottish club.
p313_405,The Open champion is back.
p313_406,It's going to be a new challenge.
p313_407,"As, indeed, they would be."
p313_408,I want to keep him.
p313_409,He deserves a top team.
p313_410,I knew people on that committee.
p313_411,The next eight weeks are critical to us.
p313_412,"Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence."
p313_413,Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p313_414,We never agreed to it.
p313_415,But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p313_416,But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p313_417,Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p313_418,Would they work together again?
