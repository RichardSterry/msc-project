p272_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p272_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p272_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p272_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p272_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p272_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p272_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p272_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p272_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p272_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p272_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p272_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p272_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p272_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p272_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p272_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p272_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p272_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p272_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p272_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p272_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p272_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p272_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p272_025,"People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
"
p272_026,"Is this accurate?
"
p272_027,"They have no history.
"
p272_028,"Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
"
p272_029,"The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
"
p272_030,"There's a story, too.
"
p272_031,"This is the window.
"
p272_032,"He was jailed for five years.
"
p272_033,"Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
"
p272_034,"We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
"
p272_035,"Then, suddenly, they weren't.
"
p272_036,"Was it worth it?
"
p272_037,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p272_038,"However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
"
p272_039,"We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
"
p272_040,"They're just different.
"
p272_041,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p272_042,"A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
"
p272_043,"Indeed, he does.
"
p272_044,"I did not see any reason to change the captain.
"
p272_045,"He's just in it for himself.
"
p272_046,"However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
"
p272_047,"It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
"
p272_048,"We will push.
"
p272_049,"Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
"
p272_050,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p272_051,"It is bizarre.
"
p272_052,"They said she was stable.
"
p272_053,"Is a drug dealer?
"
p272_054,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p272_055,"He is too weak to move.
"
p272_056,"They were on holiday in Egypt.
"
p272_057,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p272_058,"No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
"
p272_059,"Here's a clue.
"
p272_060,"It had been in place since last July.
"
p272_061,"Next league matches Celtic.
"
p272_062,"There was no safety net.
"
p272_063,"It is unique.
"
p272_064,"That's the truth.
"
p272_065,"They are ready.
"
p272_066,"We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
"
p272_067,"I feel I did not have enough time.
"
p272_068,"The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
"
p272_069,"George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
"
p272_070,"They are real.
"
p272_071,"Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
"
p272_072,"That was a gold medal for certain.
"
p272_073,"He was popular.
"
p272_074,"But I've won both ways.
"
p272_075,"There was an e-mail.
"
p272_076,"Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
"
p272_077,"Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
"
p272_078,"Painful, but only because it's true.
"
p272_079,"I had my suspicions.
"
p272_080,"He was at home with his pals.
"
p272_081,"It was magic.
"
p272_082,"The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
"
p272_083,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p272_084,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p272_085,"Even the one she loved.
"
p272_086,"Today she has been released.
"
p272_087,"He is in the queue.
"
p272_088,"He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
"
p272_089,"What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
"
p272_090,"Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
"
p272_091,"Someone who cares
"
p272_092,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p272_093,"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
"
p272_094,"It is a blow.
"
p272_095,"Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
"
p272_096,"They lived for their children.
"
p272_097,"Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
"
p272_098,"Today I couldn't run on it.
"
p272_099,"This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
"
p272_100,"I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
"
p272_101,"It was clear.
"
p272_102,"It is annoying.
"
p272_103,"But I was wrong.
"
p272_104,"I love the Dome.
"
p272_105,"We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
"
p272_106,"Our position remains unchanged.
"
p272_107,"I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
"
p272_108,"Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
"
p272_109,"Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
"
p272_110,"You should be.
"
p272_111,"After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
"
p272_112,"Two of the team became ill.
"
p272_113,"He takes the job.
"
p272_114,"She reflects a bit.
"
p272_115,"I am just trying to do my job.
"
p272_116,"Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
"
p272_117,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p272_118,"I was fighting for my life, I thought.
"
p272_119,"Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
"
p272_120,"It is so sad.
"
p272_121,"The mood is upbeat.
"
p272_122,"It is rubbish.
"
p272_123,"That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
"
p272_124,"There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
"
p272_125,"Who would have?
"
p272_126,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p272_127,"I can't even get into the A team.
"
p272_128,"I'm so angry.
"
p272_129,"She really suffered for her art.
"
p272_130,"It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
"
p272_131,"The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
"
p272_132,"No production was achieved.
"
p272_133,"The BBC was a disgrace.
"
p272_134,"This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
"
p272_135,"It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
"
p272_136,"The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
"
p272_137,"Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
"
p272_138,"Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
"
p272_139,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p272_140,"It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
"
p272_141,"I had decided to quit the show.
"
p272_142,"We want to keep the pound.
"
p272_143,"Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
"
p272_144,"And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
"
p272_145,"Who would be right?
"
p272_146,"She died at her home.
"
p272_147,"He realises his mistake.
"
p272_148,"The role of the law lords would be retained.
"
p272_149,"It is not just about pay.
"
p272_150,"Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
"
p272_151,"So I got a blood test.
"
p272_152,"It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
"
p272_153,"But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
"
p272_154,"I was so nervous.
"
p272_155,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p272_156,"The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
"
p272_157,"We also enjoyed a lot of support.
"
p272_158,"We are on a four-year mission.
"
p272_159,"They should come clean.
"
p272_160,"My Dad is a hero.
"
p272_161,"He can do no wrong.
"
p272_162,"Well, he should know.
"
p272_163,"It is so unfair.
"
p272_164,"I will tell you.
"
p272_165,"I've put my own money into this project.
"
p272_166,"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
"
p272_167,"It is not like us.
"
p272_168,"We've all had the shots.
"
p272_169,"It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
"
p272_170,"Again, we were lucky.
"
p272_171,"Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
"
p272_172,"Does that put pressure on us?
"
p272_173,"It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
"
p272_174,"They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
"
p272_175,"As we worked.
"
p272_176,"Tony had arrived.
"
p272_177,"And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
"
p272_178,"Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
"
p272_179,"It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
"
p272_180,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p272_181,"I saw military vehicles in the distance.
"
p272_182,"What has caused the demise of singing?
"
p272_183,"Our team is just so young.
"
p272_184,"Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
"
p272_185,"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
"
p272_186,"Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
"
p272_187,"But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
"
p272_188,"Peace was won.
"
p272_189,"It's a fact.
"
p272_190,"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
"
p272_191,"We believe a third party was involved.
"
p272_192,"On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
"
p272_193,"Tommy is not a problem.
"
p272_194,"I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
"
p272_195,"But she might be.
"
p272_196,"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
"
p272_197,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p272_198,"They make a selective perception process.
"
p272_199,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p272_200,"Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
"
p272_201,"This gives a financial incentive to switch.
"
p272_202,"The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
"
p272_203,"Twaddle is a case in point.
"
p272_204,"A Grampian Police spokesman said.
"
p272_205,"He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
"
p272_206,"In each case they were a goal down.
"
p272_207,"I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
"
p272_208,"However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
"
p272_209,"The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
"
p272_210,"The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
"
p272_211,"Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
"
p272_212,"I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
"
p272_213,"At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
"
p272_214,"You should always be able to get out in some direction.
"
p272_215,"It's not before time.
"
p272_216,"The report is due out next month.
"
p272_217,"But she was.
"
p272_218,"Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
"
p272_219,"At the time, he was a living legend.
"
p272_220,"They must do it.
"
p272_221,"Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
"
p272_222,"However, no further action was taken by police.
"
p272_223,"Until they came to do it.
"
p272_224,"Half of young people had had contact with the police.
"
p272_225,"Well, they were the unlucky ones.
"
p272_226,"There is no excuse.
"
p272_227,"Three weeks later, he resigned.
"
p272_228,"On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
"
p272_229,"But it's a subtle process.
"
p272_230,"He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
"
p272_231,"Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
"
p272_232,"In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
"
p272_233,"A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
"
p272_234,"It is hard won.
"
p272_235,"Our policy is clear.
"
p272_236,"The scene is about this?
"
p272_237,"The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
"
p272_238,"There wasn't a goal.
"
p272_239,"I should think so, too.
"
p272_240,"There's the mix.
"
p272_241,"The concerns are the same.
"
p272_242,"I can't get a job.
"
p272_243,"For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
"
p272_244,"It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
"
p272_245,"However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
"
p272_246,"One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
"
p272_247,"So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
"
p272_248,"Is that a serious question?
"
p272_249,"This is the first step.
"
p272_250,"They must play for each other.
"
p272_251,"Souter will be back.
"
p272_252,"George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
"
p272_253,"Blood samples were taken.
"
p272_254,"They want to shut the Scottish Office.
"
p272_255,"We shall rely on human beings.
"
p272_256,"This is a question of Islam.
"
p272_257,"He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
"
p272_258,"Immediate action must be taken.
"
p272_259,"It's very nice.
"
p272_260,"He was also married with two children.
"
p272_261,"The system can work.
"
p272_262,"It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
"
p272_263,"We're in shock.
"
p272_264,"Our objective is to tackle poverty.
"
p272_265,"It's a way of life.
"
p272_266,"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
"
p272_267,"It was very fast.
"
p272_268,"The record companies have gone through the floor.
"
p272_269,"He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
"
p272_270,"In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
"
p272_271,"If not, he should go home.
"
p272_272,"It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
"
p272_273,"He looked very sharp.
"
p272_274,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p272_275,"All options are open.
"
p272_276,"Dialogue is the key.
"
p272_277,"They have shown a great desire and attitude.
"
p272_278,"It was a virus.
"
p272_279,"Maloney is an engaging talent.
"
p272_280,"The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
"
p272_281,"This is a national crisis.
"
p272_282,"It was good.
"
p272_283,"Who did the recruiting?
"
p272_284,"Bombing slaughter rejected
"
p272_285,"The songs are just so good.
"
p272_286,"The goals will come.
"
p272_287,"There's a pause.
"
p272_288,"That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
"
p272_289,"I was the sheep.
"
p272_290,"What has altered?
"
p272_291,"I was brought up in a mining background.
"
p272_292,"Nothing is safe.
"
p272_293,"It would still have been a good film, but very different.
"
p272_294,"One was a lawyer.
"
p272_295,"The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
"
p272_296,"They are wrong.
"
p272_297,"Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
"
p272_298,"The plot is minimal.
"
p272_299,"You are the glory.
"
p272_300,"However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
"
p272_301,"The letters are going out today.
"
p272_302,"We want to play at the worlds.
"
p272_303,"He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
"
p272_304,"My whole life has changed.
"
p272_305,"We are a peaceful people.
"
p272_306,"You may have a short memory.
"
p272_307,"It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
"
p272_308,"My body is clearly capable.
"
p272_309,"Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
"
p272_310,"It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
"
p272_311,"A review is under way.
"
p272_312,"It will work.
"
p272_313,"I came into this world with nothing.
"
p272_314,"It's too horrible to think.
"
p272_315,"We think all other measures are not exhausted.
"
p272_316,"Off with their heads.
"
p272_317,"Is there a new way forward?
"
p272_318,"I was invited to work in Germany.
"
p272_319,"Is that an issue?
"
p272_320,"Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
"
p272_321,"You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
"
p272_322,"The same things will happen with GM foods.
"
p272_323,"I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
"
p272_324,"It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
"
p272_325,"Well, it won't.
"
p272_326,"These days are long gone.
"
p272_327,"Two people were interviewed.
"
p272_328,"I've got no secret.
"
p272_329,"The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
"
p272_330,"We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
"
p272_331,"In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
"
p272_332,"Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
"
p272_333,"A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
"
p272_334,"This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
"
p272_335,"He loves the big occasions.
"
p272_336,"The performance was excellent.
"
p272_337,"That has been lost.
"
p272_338,"Tell us about it.
"
p272_339,"He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
"
p272_340,"She said they would appeal.
"
p272_341,"A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
"
p272_342,"Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
"
p272_343,"Both of those promises have already been honoured.
"
p272_344,"In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
"
p272_345,"It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
"
p272_346,"As, indeed, they would be.
"
p272_347,"It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
"
p272_348,"To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
"
