p231_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p231_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p231_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p231_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p231_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p231_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p231_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p231_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p231_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p231_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p231_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p231_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p231_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p231_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p231_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p231_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p231_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p231_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p231_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p231_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p231_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p231_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p231_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p231_025,"On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
"
p231_026,"I'd just like to play.
"
p231_027,"Because we do not need it.
"
p231_028,"There was a rush of water.
"
p231_029,"Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
"
p231_030,"That deal is a joke.
"
p231_031,"The Premier League has been a huge success.
"
p231_032,"If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
"
p231_033,"It carried a double message.
"
p231_034,"That means an extra two years.
"
p231_035,"I became a widow overnight.
"
p231_036,"But he can turn on the charm.
"
p231_037,"You must always attempt to raise the bar.
"
p231_038,"The man became a reporter.
"
p231_039,"Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.
"
p231_040,"Last year, I was pretty bad.
"
p231_041,"Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
"
p231_042,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p231_043,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p231_044,"He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
"
p231_045,"I guess I was lucky, though.
"
p231_046,"I was inspired by two things.
"
p231_047,"A win is a win.
"
p231_048,"There was no safety net.
"
p231_049,"There's nothing we could do about this.
"
p231_050,"It is a symbolic concert.
"
p231_051,"We keep an eye on it.
"
p231_052,"We have not given up hope.
"
p231_053,"The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
"
p231_054,"She said she was really sorry.
"
p231_055,"In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
"
p231_056,"Italy is a beautiful place.
"
p231_057,"Four other charges were dropped.
"
p231_058,"We should be able to cope.
"
p231_059,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p231_061,"So is that it, then ?
"
p231_062,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p231_063,"What do we do ?
"
p231_064,"It was a lovely experience.
"
p231_065,"The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
"
p231_066,"We will pay their bills.
"
p231_067,"Only water is currently allowed.
"
p231_068,"He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
"
p231_069,"We need to increase the membership.
"
p231_070,"This is an exciting new venture.
"
p231_071,"He highlighted a lack of staff.
"
p231_072,"Then followed a bout of flu.
"
p231_073,"Both sides have been hit by injury.
"
p231_074,"Both men were on one-year contracts.
"
p231_076,"That would be too easy.
"
p231_078,"After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
"
p231_079,"Both agreed on the success of the event.
"
p231_080,"Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
"
p231_081,"On Saturday, it was much the same.
"
p231_082,"It's so hard to shift.
"
p231_083,"They lived for their children.
"
p231_085,"However, it did not end that way.
"
p231_086,"Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
"
p231_087,"It is an old family habit.
"
p231_088,"He's been hit by it.
"
p231_089,"However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
"
p231_090,"I saw the whole thing.
"
p231_091,"But I know the course.
"
p231_092,"Their attitude is all wrong.
"
p231_093,"We must stop it with the golf ball.
"
p231_094,"You are like an animal.
"
p231_095,"This is the logic of punishment assaults.
"
p231_097,"We should recognise others have done a good job.
"
p231_098,"We live by the rule of law.
"
p231_099,"Two of the team became ill.
"
p231_100,"No, the equipment is extra.
"
p231_101,"That time is not now, however.
"
p231_102,"It's not a quick fix.
"
p231_103,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p231_104,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p231_105,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p231_106,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p231_107,"And does it ?
"
p231_108,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p231_109,"We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
"
p231_110,"You'd better believe it.
"
p231_111,"New Year will be very busy.
"
p231_112,"There's still plenty time left.
"
p231_113,"It proved a good decision.
"
p231_114,"Maybe this battle has been.
"
p231_115,"January is a bad time of year.
"
p231_116,"I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
"
p231_117,"It is much as it has been described.
"
p231_118,"Then again, we could have.
"
p231_119,"It is a delight on every level.
"
p231_120,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p231_121,"I was just a child.
"
p231_122,"We should not be surprised.
"
p231_123,"It was not a finale he would want to remember.
"
p231_124,"Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
"
p231_125,"That period was a struggle.
"
p231_126,"It is too pretty, it is too small.
"
p231_127,"This should begin in October.
"
p231_128,"That is far too high.
"
p231_129,"If not, a deal could take many months.
"
p231_130,"It plans to return to this field.
"
p231_131,"They made such decisions in London.
"
p231_132,"Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
"
p231_133,"It is a common problem.
"
p231_134,"You're a gambling man.
"
p231_135,"We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
"
p231_136,"He is a great addition to our team.
"
p231_137,"This is a successful outcome.
"
p231_138,"In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
"
p231_139,"Put yourself in the position of being a referee.
"
p231_140,"I think he's the favourite, no question.
"
p231_141,"I miss the freedom that I had.
"
p231_142,"It only increased the support for him.
"
p231_143,"Anyone can do the sums.
"
p231_144,"Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
"
p231_145,"It opens the door to the Champions League.
"
p231_146,"It has become a way of life.
"
p231_147,"The whole industry is a shambles.
"
p231_148,"There's only one team in Ayrshire.
"
p231_149,"It was deployed in the Gulf War.
"
p231_150,"We have a clean bill of health.
"
p231_151,"It is not normal practice.
"
p231_152,"The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
"
p231_153,"He was asked to quit.
"
p231_154,"A new school will be built.
"
p231_155,"The strong pound also took its toll.
"
p231_156,"It is a terrible tragedy.
"
p231_157,"He was right into football from an early age.
"
p231_158,"It is not like us.
"
p231_159,"What happened in that game ?
"
p231_160,"Are you going to win ?
"
p231_161,"Was it the wife ?
"
p231_162,"Why change it ?
"
p231_163,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p231_164,"He was in great spirits.
"
p231_165,"We have a budget in March.
"
p231_166,"You've been a great audience.
"
p231_167,"It is simply not true.
"
p231_168,"Well, this article is a bit like that.
"
p231_169,"It is really good news.
"
p231_170,"We've made a couple of albums.
"
p231_171,"To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
"
p231_172,"My life has been destroyed.
"
p231_173,"I always felt they played for me.
"
p231_174,"One season, they might do well.
"
p231_175,"First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
"
p231_176,"This much I can tell you.
"
p231_177,"The Hibs manager is no fool.
"
p231_178,"We are the gateway to justice.
"
p231_179,"But one was not enough.
"
p231_180,"I have spoken to head office.
"
p231_181,"I am not ready to walk away.
"
p231_183,"The shooting created panic in the street.
"
p231_184,"So many people will be affected by this.
"
p231_185,"As many as the market will support.
"
p231_186,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p231_188,"This is the time to use it.
"
p231_189,"You know the sort of thing.
"
p231_190,"I'm interested in interesting work.
"
p231_191,"We represent a wide range of society.
"
p231_192,"People will ask about us.
"
p231_193,"Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
"
p231_194,"This should put downward pressure on inflation.
"
p231_195,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p231_196,"I came home by ambulance.
"
p231_197,"I suggest a new plan.
"
p231_198,"It was a moment of madness.
"
p231_199,"Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
"
p231_200,"Libya is an easy target.
"
p231_201,"Does the name matter ?
"
p231_202,"how do you get it back ?
"
p231_203,"What are you no good at ?
"
p231_205,"Who was she ?
"
p231_206,"It gave no further details.
"
p231_207,"You've caught a serial killer.
"
p231_208,"I won't make an official complaint.
"
p231_209,"We are a new department.
"
p231_210,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p231_211,"They are looking at flotation.
"
p231_212,"Which isn't a bad idea.
"
p231_213,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p231_214,"He also presented You Bet!
"
p231_215,"That might help a bit.
"
p231_216,"I had decided to quit the show.
"
p231_217,"He has a lot of skill.
"
p231_218,"I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
"
p231_219,"However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
"
p231_220,"And the World Cup has not even begun.
"
p231_221,"The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
"
p231_222,"That you can do it.
"
p231_223,"It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
"
p231_224,"They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
"
p231_225,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p231_226,"This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
"
p231_228,"We played them off the pitch.
"
p231_229,"So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
"
p231_230,"They are the innocent victims.
"
p231_231,"Paterson can afford to be generous.
"
p231_232,"She died in middle age.
"
p231_233,"I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
"
p231_234,"It is set in Paris.
"
p231_235,"The irony was not lost.
"
p231_236,"Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
"
p231_237,"Hospitals are for the ill.
"
p231_238,"The minister is the engineer.
"
p231_239,"My future is in the marathon.
"
p231_240,"It is now the big brother.
"
p231_241,"The parties have no contact.
"
p231_242,"She took them for a term.
"
p231_243,"Nato was not a love affair.
"
p231_244,"He is due in Israel tomorrow.
"
p231_245,"You can feel at home in China.
"
p231_246,"His is a global perspective.
"
p231_247,"Persuaded to change his mind.
"
p231_248,"Either way, the investor retains the premium.
"
p231_249,"This ruling is a farce.
"
p231_250,"The baby deserves the credit.
"
p231_251,"Washington is consumed by the crisis.
"
p231_252,"But they were never expected to last.
"
p231_253,"It was a cry for help.
"
p231_254,"No production contract is yet in sight.
"
p231_255,"Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
"
p231_256,"A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
"
p231_257,"He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
"
p231_258,"It seems a shame to leave it.
"
p231_259,"It was the climax of the thing.
"
p231_260,"The concerns are the same.
"
p231_261,"I can't get a job.
"
p231_262,"And they were being paid ?
"
p231_263,"was everything done to save people ?
"
p231_264,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p231_265,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p231_266,"Is it in the right place ?
"
p231_267,"Did he trip ?
"
p231_268,"I've had the time of my life.
"
p231_269,"The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
"
p231_270,"On the contrary they stand to gain.
"
p231_271,"I thought he might have been a bit.
"
p231_272,"This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
"
p231_273,"I'd never run for them.
"
p231_274,"It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
"
p231_275,"It does not work that way in Scottish football.
"
p231_276,"These figures are truly terrible.
"
p231_277,"Share prices have fallen for three years in a row.
"
p231_278,"The joint bid is still on course.
"
p231_279,"At first I thought I was gone.
"
p231_280,"The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
"
p231_281,"They can leave at any time.
"
p231_282,"That view has not altered.
"
p231_283,"You get a lot for your money.
"
p231_284,"Blair also had a penalty.
"
p231_285,"It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
"
p231_286,"Frankly, we should all have such problems.
"
p231_288,"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
"
p231_289,"She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
"
p231_290,"They were on holiday in Egypt.
"
p231_291,"It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
"
p231_292,"I've lost all confidence.
"
p231_293,"This could be a mistake.
"
p231_294,"Once again, they would be wrong.
"
p231_295,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p231_296,"It's all designed to speed up the service.
"
p231_297,"He will address the nation this evening.
"
p231_298,"They have shown a great desire and attitude.
"
p231_299,"I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
"
p231_300,"But it is up again.
"
p231_301,"Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
"
p231_302,"It could well be military.
"
p231_303,"I was just so determined.
"
p231_304,"That was the difference between the sides.
"
p231_305,"The judge was really nice.
"
p231_307,"You are a different people.
"
p231_308,"Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
"
p231_309,"He is still in shock.
"
p231_310,"McNaughton was not so sure.
"
p231_312,"I thought it was my only chance.
"
p231_313,"I thought he did very well.
"
p231_314,"I'm not making any comment at all.
"
p231_315,"Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
"
p231_316,"We're on our way.
"
p231_317,"They come to enjoy themselves.
"
p231_318,"That meant the search was unlawful.
"
p231_319,"They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
"
p231_320,"However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
"
p231_322,"We want to play at the worlds.
"
p231_323,"However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
"
p231_324,"We have got no money to go anywhere.
"
p231_325,"Have a look at this lot.
"
p231_326,"That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
"
p231_327,"The king is delighted by the honour.
"
p231_328,"It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
"
p231_329,"The problems began a long time ago.
"
p231_330,"I am not sure about the rate of progress.
"
p231_331,"To beat the European champion is quite nice.
"
p231_332,"In the old days, it was easy.
"
p231_333,"However, the groups denied the claims.
"
p231_334,"She is now on the back benches.
"
p231_336,"I think it's about time.
"
p231_337,"The airport was even different.
"
p231_338,"There was no time scale.
"
p231_339,"In his absence, the council adopted the change.
"
p231_340,"At first, the youngster was not keen.
"
p231_341,"The figures are bad, but not that bad.
"
p231_342,"Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
"
p231_343,"Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
"
p231_344,"He was then replaced by Ross.
"
p231_345,"Finally came the moment of truth.
"
p231_346,"We are encouraged by the news.
"
p231_347,"What form did that take ?
"
p231_348,"Are they free ?
"
p231_349,"What are they for ?
"
p231_350,"Is there a waiting list ?
"
p231_351,"Do they think anyone else wants them ?
"
p231_352,"So what happens next ?
"
p231_353,"The units will not be replaced.
"
p231_354,"Neither man has been charged.
"
p231_355,"Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
"
p231_357,"Look at the Liberal Democrats.
"
p231_358,"I am a lucky man.
"
p231_359,"But they have taken the lesson to heart.
"
p231_360,"I've always been a sensitive.
"
p231_361,"Glasgow is a friendly city.
"
p231_362,"You did not see it.
"
p231_363,"We live on an island.
"
p231_364,"It is not real life.
"
p231_365,"Neither woman has been named.
"
p231_366,"They should take their mobile phones.
"
p231_367,"You need a licence to run a pub.
"
p231_368,"We regret that they're brought in the first place.
"
p231_369,"Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
"
p231_370,"This is a major championship.
"
p231_371,"The result is called a patent.
"
p231_372,"But we finished the show.
"
p231_373,"They were to blame for the first two goals.
"
p231_374,"There is no deal as yet.
"
p231_375,"Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
"
