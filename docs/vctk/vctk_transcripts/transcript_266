p266_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p266_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p266_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p266_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p266_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p266_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p266_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p266_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p266_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p266_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p266_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p266_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p266_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p266_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p266_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p266_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p266_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p266_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p266_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p266_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p266_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p266_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p266_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p266_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p266_025,"She looked so young.
"
p266_026,"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
"
p266_027,"Is this accurate?
"
p266_028,"Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
"
p266_029,"There's a story, too.
"
p266_030,"They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
"
p266_031,"Then, suddenly, they weren't.
"
p266_032,"IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
"
p266_033,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p266_034,"However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
"
p266_035,"It was clear.
"
p266_036,"A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
"
p266_037,"Indeed, he does.
"
p266_038,"People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
"
p266_039,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p266_040,"Dancing was her life.
"
p266_041,"It's the only thing.
"
p266_042,"It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
"
p266_043,"The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
"
p266_044,"A neighbour said.
"
p266_045,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p266_046,"Is a drug dealer?
"
p266_047,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p266_048,"In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
"
p266_049,"No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
"
p266_050,"There was a substantial explosion.
"
p266_051,"Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
"
p266_052,"He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
"
p266_053,"I expect a rapid response.
"
p266_054,"What was the main difference?
"
p266_055,"We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
"
p266_056,"They're appalled by that.
"
p266_057,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p266_058,"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
"
p266_059,"We should have known.
"
p266_060,"Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
"
p266_061,"We recorded it at our own expense.
"
p266_062,"Try to save us.
"
p266_063,"Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
"
p266_064,"Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
"
p266_065,"Painful, but only because it's true.
"
p266_066,"He was at home with his pals.
"
p266_067,"It's all I can do.
"
p266_068,"I was as strong as a horse.
"
p266_069,"Then followed a bout of flu.
"
p266_070,"Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
"
p266_071,"Neither it is.
"
p266_072,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p266_073,"It works for us.
"
p266_074,"The party is up for it.
"
p266_075,"Even the one she loved.
"
p266_076,"Today she has been released.
"
p266_077,"The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
"
p266_078,"I will miss him.
"
p266_079,"He is in the queue.
"
p266_080,"I first met him last summer.
"
p266_081,"He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
"
p266_082,"He is driven.
"
p266_083,"He seems to be pleased with the picture.
"
p266_084,"Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
"
p266_085,"Someone who cares
"
p266_086,"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
"
p266_087,"They lived for their children.
"
p266_088,"It will be tight.
"
p266_089,"It is a lifeline.
"
p266_090,"Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
"
p266_091,"It's good news.
"
p266_092,"That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
"
p266_093,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p266_094,"I love the Dome.
"
p266_095,"We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
"
p266_096,"I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
"
p266_097,"I saw the whole thing.
"
p266_098,"Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
"
p266_099,"Journalists should make him.
"
p266_100,"May not have been at fault?
"
p266_101,"Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
"
p266_102,"Here, again, they were denied a voice.
"
p266_103,"That would be unlawful.
"
p266_104,"Oil embargo endorsed.
"
p266_105,"He takes the job.
"
p266_106,"She reflects a bit.
"
p266_107,"Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
"
p266_108,"Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
"
p266_109,"It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
"
p266_110,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p266_111,"It was a funny game.
"
p266_112,"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
"
p266_113,"Is that right?
"
p266_114,"It is a total and utter change of culture.
"
p266_115,"He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
"
p266_116,"It's a shame.
"
p266_117,"It was the eighties.
"
p266_118,"I did not see any reason to change the captain.
"
p266_119,"In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
"
p266_120,"Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
"
p266_121,"There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
"
p266_122,"Who would have?
"
p266_123,"We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
"
p266_124,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p266_125,"I'm so angry.
"
p266_126,"It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
"
p266_127,"I was on a roll.
"
p266_128,"The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
"
p266_129,"We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
"
p266_130,"We work well together.
"
p266_131,"The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
"
p266_132,"Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
"
p266_133,"Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
"
p266_134,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p266_135,"It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
"
p266_136,"Is that it?
"
p266_137,"He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
"
p266_138,"I was dead.
"
p266_139,"I don't know the full story.
"
p266_140,"And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
"
p266_141,"Who would be right?
"
p266_142,"She died at her home.
"
p266_143,"He realises his mistake.
"
p266_144,"He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
"
p266_145,"I was awful.
"
p266_146,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p266_147,"He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
"
p266_148,"It is not just about pay.
"
p266_149,"Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
"
p266_150,"So I got a blood test.
"
p266_151,"But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
"
p266_152,"The weather forecast isn't good.
"
p266_153,"The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
"
p266_154,"They have not been named.
"
p266_155,"I might come back.
"
p266_156,"We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
"
p266_157,"My Dad is a hero.
"
p266_158,"For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
"
p266_159,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p266_160,"There's a pause.
"
p266_161,"Was this element always there?
"
p266_162,"I've put my own money into this project.
"
p266_163,"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
"
p266_164,"We need a new kind of theatre.
"
p266_165,"I haven't had a lesson in four years.
"
p266_166,"Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
"
p266_167,"We try to keep it right.
"
p266_168,"Seven people were later detained by police.
"
p266_169,"It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
"
p266_170,"By then, however, both men were already in the US.
"
p266_171,"Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
"
p266_172,"She said she would not welcome the flowers.
"
p266_173,"It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
"
p266_174,"They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
"
p266_175,"One season, they might do well.
"
p266_176,"Is Saddam a threat?
"
p266_177,"As we worked.
"
p266_178,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p266_179,"I'm just going to hit the shot.
"
p266_180,"Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
"
p266_181,"I've been there.
"
p266_182,"And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
"
p266_183,"It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
"
p266_184,"I saw military vehicles in the distance.
"
p266_186,"What has caused the demise of singing?
"
p266_187,"Our team is just so young.
"
p266_188,"O Neill has delivered.
"
p266_189,"Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
"
p266_190,"But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
"
p266_191,"It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
"
p266_192,"I came home by ambulance.
"
p266_193,"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
"
p266_194,"Is that success?
"
p266_195,"The service from the other players was super.
"
p266_196,"Tommy is not a problem.
"
p266_197,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p266_198,"Who will pay for this?
"
p266_199,"The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
"
p266_200,"It's just awful.
"
p266_201,"It's all about money, money, money.
"
p266_202,"It's a question of creating a future awareness.
"
p266_203,"He knows a lot.
"
p266_204,"We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
"
p266_205,"It had all been arranged.
"
p266_206,"It's not before time.
"
p266_207,"So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
"
p266_208,"We want to keep the pound.
"
p266_209,"I was so nervous.
"
p266_210,"He seemed to lose his focus.
"
p266_211,"Work has started.
"
p266_212,"The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
"
p266_213,"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
"
p266_214,"But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
"
p266_215,"During the communist time they were very privileged.
"
p266_216,"This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
"
p266_217,"Saturday is gone.
"
p266_218,"Because they didn't want to know.
"
p266_219,"The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
"
p266_220,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p266_221,"Clearly, the stakes are high.
"
p266_222,"I will win.
"
p266_223,"It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
"
p266_224,"The report is due out next month.
"
p266_225,"We were awful.
"
p266_226,"They tried to give her advice.
"
p266_227,"They have now become the focus of a huge police inquiry.
"
p266_228,"They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
"
p266_229,"Half of young people had had contact with the police.
"
p266_230,"There is no excuse.
"
p266_231,"It's quite nice.
"
p266_232,"It would still have been a good film, but very different.
"
p266_233,"Of further privacy, he had no need.
"
p266_234,"It's a killer piece.
"
p266_235,"I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
"
p266_236,"In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
"
p266_237,"It is hard won.
"
p266_238,"It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
"
p266_239,"You can feel at home in China.
"
p266_240,"The scene is about this?
"
p266_241,"The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
"
p266_242,"We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
"
p266_243,"My son was too young to die.
"
p266_244,"In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
"
p266_245,"I should think so, too.
"
p266_246,"It was a hit.
"
p266_247,"There's the mix.
"
p266_248,"There will be widespread support on all sides.
"
p266_249,"He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
"
p266_250,"We are in a war.
"
p266_251,"For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
"
p266_252,"It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
"
p266_253,"That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
"
p266_254,"It was like the old days.
"
p266_255,"However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
"
p266_256,"Chelsea was a great club.
"
p266_257,"It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
"
p266_258,"We have to expand.
"
p266_259,"However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
"
p266_260,"Souter will be back.
"
p266_261,"Note the date.
"
p266_262,"It will be done in stages.
"
p266_263,"That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
"
p266_264,"You take a risk.
"
p266_265,"He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
"
p266_266,"I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
"
p266_267,"He was also married with two children.
"
p266_268,"The system can work.
"
p266_269,"We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
"
p266_270,"It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
"
p266_271,"We're in shock.
"
p266_272,"Our objective is to tackle poverty.
"
p266_273,"Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
"
p266_274,"That goes back a long way.
"
p266_275,"It was very fast.
"
p266_276,"She failed in her action.
"
p266_277,"He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
"
p266_278,"They seem to get away with it.
"
p266_279,"He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
"
p266_280,"It's so awful.
"
p266_281,"It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
"
p266_282,"Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
"
p266_283,"Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
"
p266_284,"Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
"
p266_285,"Dialogue is the key.
"
p266_286,"They have shown a great desire and attitude.
"
p266_287,"Tony Blair said as little.
"
p266_288,"She is an expert on medical ethics.
"
p266_289,"It was good.
"
p266_290,"Who did the recruiting?
"
p266_291,"Bombing slaughter rejected
"
p266_292,"It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
"
p266_293,"It could well be military.
"
p266_294,"No Briton has ever won.
"
p266_295,"Robin Williams is very subdued.
"
p266_296,"Spent three months alone at sea.
"
p266_297,"He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
"
p266_298,"There was a vacuum.
"
p266_299,"We lost a boy.
"
p266_300,"Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
"
p266_301,"I was brought up in a mining background.
"
p266_302,"In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
"
p266_303,"Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
"
p266_304,"The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
"
p266_305,"The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
"
p266_306,"I can give no comment.
"
p266_307,"But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
"
p266_308,"This is a war over our home.
"
p266_309,"Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
"
p266_310,"The plot is minimal.
"
p266_311,"They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
"
p266_312,"You should be.
"
p266_313,"The minister is the engineer.
"
p266_314,"I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
"
p266_315,"We have got no money to go anywhere.
"
p266_316,"Your father was a good man.
"
p266_317,"We are a peaceful people.
"
p266_318,"You may have a short memory.
"
p266_319,"The problems began a long time ago.
"
p266_320,"Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
"
p266_321,"In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
"
p266_322,"A review is under way.
"
p266_323,"We are in the end game.
"
p266_324,"It's too horrible to think.
"
p266_325,"The airport was even different.
"
p266_326,"They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
"
p266_327,"There was no time scale.
"
p266_328,"But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
"
p266_329,"Is there a new way forward?
"
p266_330,"On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
"
p266_331,"Finally, he paid for the movie.
"
p266_332,"However, they will only be found in the wild.
"
p266_333,"Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
"
p266_334,"Who will do it?
"
p266_335,"Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
"
p266_336,"Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
"
p266_337,"Two people were interviewed.
"
p266_338,"We've tried every other way.
"
p266_339,"This is a big advantage.
"
p266_340,"Maloney was asked.
"
p266_341,"But I was knocked out by the city.
"
p266_342,"went on sale.
"
p266_343,"I'm very lucky.
"
p266_344,"Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
"
p266_345,"A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
"
p266_346,"It is long gone.
"
p266_347,"The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
