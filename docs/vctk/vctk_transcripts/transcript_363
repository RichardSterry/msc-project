p363_001,Please call Stella.
p363_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p363_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p363_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p363_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p363_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p363_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p363_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p363_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p363_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p363_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p363_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p363_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p363_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p363_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p363_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p363_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p363_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p363_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p363_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p363_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p363_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p363_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p363_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p363_025,It's never been to committee.
p363_026,Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p363_027,"It was actually very, very difficult."
p363_028,The proposals were not new.
p363_029,He scored one goal and was on fire.
p363_030,His party never arrived.
p363_031,Visitors are directed instantly to the shop.
p363_032,"If that is the case, it is a breakthrough."
p363_033,He gave no other details.
p363_034,It's not an improvement for him.
p363_035,I think it is wide open.
p363_036,It certainly is cause for concern.
p363_037,It's on with a roller.
p363_038,"The captaincy will help that, too."
p363_039,That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
p363_040,I think we're a long way forward.
p363_041,The impact was immediate.
p363_042,There is a new confidence about the club.
p363_043,His film is not.
p363_044,It is the strength of the school.
p363_045,"In my experience, he does not do that."
p363_046,That is good news.
p363_047,This has come as a shock to everyone.
p363_048,He will never be forgotten.
p363_049,I was not overly concerned about this.
p363_050,He was very grateful for his health.
p363_051,The nation has his music.
p363_052,But real life is not like that.
p363_053,So now we know.
p363_054,That is why this action has been taken.
p363_055,Who will pay for this?
p363_056,The defender should have won the bloody ba.
p363_057,There has been a reduction in cleaning standards.
p363_058,We were upset about the referee.
p363_059,That is our objective.
p363_060,What's the problem?
p363_061,He is not alone.
p363_062,He did that last Sunday.
p363_063,There wasn't anything in it.
p363_064,The club is afflicted by injuries.
p363_065,Sentencing is also being considered in that review.
p363_066,Lovely day isn't it?
p363_067,It was far from business as usual.
p363_068,Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p363_069,The show is not over.
p363_070,Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p363_071,This is a judgment issue.
p363_072,Thirty people have applied for his job!
p363_073,It was just an accident.
p363_074,We are not commenting at the moment.
p363_075,Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p363_076,Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.
p363_077,He is slightly confused.
p363_078,We did not deserve to go through.
p363_079,The course has helped a lot.
p363_080,"All the time, that number was coming down and down."
p363_081,There is room for me.
p363_082,That can only be a good thing.
p363_083,I have never seen anything like this.
p363_084,They are difficult awards to decide.
p363_085,It was that kind of war.
p363_086,That is my preference.
p363_087,"He later told The Herald, It is true."
p363_088,It has come a long way since then.
p363_089,It was decided he should be dismissed.
p363_090,But someone has got to do it.
p363_091,We have not given up.
p363_092,It was the turning point of the afternoon.
p363_093,I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
p363_094,What has happened?
p363_095,"If they are not, the commission will take action."
p363_096,Where will the money come from?
p363_097,She is still very poorly.
p363_098,It was good fun.
p363_099,This is a great shame.
p363_100,We talk about effective military action.
p363_101,I can't get it.
p363_102,It was entirely justified.
p363_103,He demanded to speak to the boss.
p363_104,It's somewhere in between.
p363_105,The play was to go straight ahead.
p363_106,He had never run the distance before.
p363_107,I am the head.
p363_108,He is obviously very dangerous.
p363_109,It can be very worrying.
p363_110,"It's harder, believe me."
p363_111,We are making no comment.
p363_112,I sit at home a lot.
p363_113,That was certainly the case for the parties.
p363_114,I hope the couples are still together.
p363_115,We have learned a tremendous amount.
p363_116,But that is not enough.
p363_117,These people are helpless.
p363_118,I wish him well.
p363_119,Only the details have to be sorted out.
p363_120,It would be really interesting if they did.
p363_121,That takes a lot of courage.
p363_122,"Sadly, it is not to be."
p363_123,Motorists will welcome this.
p363_124,I welcome this Bill.
p363_125,This is not a problem.
p363_126,he announced his plans.
p363_127,He is the man to beat.
p363_128,We are getting not a penny.
p363_129,Look at the turn-out.
p363_130,Which brings us to the question of money.
p363_131,It is very simple.
p363_132,There was something special about that.
p363_133,Many other areas are coming up.
p363_134,"Sadly, it sounds as if it is."
p363_135,There were no reports of casualties.
p363_136,But it's a subtle process.
p363_137,She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p363_138,I will be having talks with the workforce.
p363_139,Changes need to be made.
p363_140,Things are going well.
p363_141,Hard it will be.
p363_142,I was deeply worried.
p363_143,Maybe it will work there.
p363_144,How does it all work?
p363_145,We could easily have lost that game.
p363_146,There's a lot of it going on.
p363_147,I doubt it would be genuine.
p363_148,It would be a masterclass.
p363_149,It would have been a very explosive issue.
p363_150,I didn't really expect to be called up.
p363_151,They will not be going back.
p363_152,The progress has been steady.
p363_153,It has no chance.
p363_154,His body was never found.
p363_155,"If true, it will be the first sign of dissent."
p363_156,We have been extremely busy.
p363_157,It appears to have been successful.
p363_158,This is a big game for them.
p363_159,We still have to wait for that.
p363_160,He said it was his greatest work.
p363_161,I feel a little betrayed.
p363_162,The baby deserves the credit.
p363_163,I live for today.
p363_164,I have been very stupid.
p363_165,I always savour the company of The Voice.
p363_166,My father and mother are.
p363_167,But that was his nature.
p363_168,We have been together for five years.
p363_169,They would never let him go.
p363_170,So what's in store?
p363_171,He didn't know where to look.
p363_172,The German had a point to make.
p363_173,There are two characters.
p363_174,The only trouble is finding them.
p363_175,Scotland won by six wickets.
p363_176,Her body has never been found.
p363_177,It is all credit to them today.
p363_178,That was a huge experience.
p363_179,Perhaps it was just as well.
p363_180,Will he be here for the weekend?
p363_181,He can do everything.
p363_182,Now is the time for action.
p363_183,Public safety is paramount.
p363_184,I feel really confident in that department.
p363_185,They were not consulted.
p363_186,He had an apartment ready.
p363_187,The prime minister will make the decision.
p363_188,THERE's only one word for it.
p363_189,We're trying to get rounded performers.
p363_190,It was far more important than that.
p363_191,That is European law.
p363_192,Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
p363_193,Their appeal will be heard this week.
p363_194,Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
p363_195,Why is he not fighting for the Union?
p363_196,A decision is expected tomorrow.
p363_197,I wanted to get on with it.
p363_198,I don't think it's the area.
p363_199,"Well, you might have a point."
p363_200,It was a horrible moment.
p363_201,It was quite distressing for the crew.
p363_202,Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
p363_203,I really had to concentrate.
p363_204,We didn't want any trouble.
p363_205,"Frankly, they have to crack down."
p363_206,The training will take place in Downing Street.
p363_207,We have still got the fight in us.
p363_208,That decision is now being appealed.
p363_209,This is really good news for us.
p363_210,I wanted to have a go.
p363_211,A senior party insider said.
p363_212,We got on very well.
p363_213,I think it must be the uniforms.
p363_214,This is not a monument to the past.
p363_215,We can all understand that.
p363_216,You are going to have to do it.
p363_217,I was amazed at her knowledge.
p363_218,Where is the evidence?
p363_219,It was important in training terms.
p363_220,Ours is on for two days.
p363_221,We don't want that at all.
p363_222,Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p363_223,The group will report back in the summer.
p363_224,Among them is his beloved teacher.
p363_225,We don't come here for our health.
p363_226,That in itself is a joke.
p363_227,They know nothing about the sport.
p363_228,But we shall have to talk to him.
p363_229,"Well, we know now."
p363_230,He was only doing his job.
p363_231,They chose the latter.
p363_232,The legal process could last weeks.
p363_233,All were later allowed home.
p363_234,I can do this on my own.
p363_235,Will you just put it away?
p363_236,I think it's more important to have fun.
p363_237,By then it was too late.
p363_238,I am very sorry to hear about this.
p363_239,I'm so looking forward to it.
p363_240,I think we can do well.
p363_241,That ignorance is crucial.
p363_242,It was an excellent performance.
p363_243,It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p363_244,"Clearly, there was a mix-up."
p363_245,I have not had much of him.
p363_246,"Sub Not Used, MacKay."
p363_247,We are taking no chances this time.
p363_248,He is to be commended.
p363_249,I can hardly believe it.
p363_250,The goals will come.
p363_251,I don't feel like working.
p363_252,Then one day it happened.
p363_253,I sit in the car.
p363_254,We stopped at half-time.
p363_255,I was brought up in a mining background.
p363_256,All winners should be tested.
p363_257,We would like to see them in court.
p363_258,I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p363_259,It is not a soap opera.
p363_260,"Whatever we do, we know we can do well."
p363_261,They may not always be so lucky.
p363_262,Where was the point in all this?
p363_263,He was travelling to see his daughter.
p363_264,It's an hour of the same response.
p363_265,This is the root of their problems.
p363_266,Two other men have recovered.
p363_267,It will be a challenging film.
p363_268,The test case is still awaiting action.
p363_269,She is under police escort.
p363_270,"However, that is not in itself enough."
p363_271,That should not be their conclusion.
p363_272,We're going to fight it.
p363_273,The plot is minimal.
p363_274,His funeral is not expected until next week.
p363_275,Now we have had enough.
p363_276,Can you believe it?
p363_277,He is certainly not looking for another job.
p363_278,I have a problem with these things.
p363_280,The gap is closing.
p363_281,Then there was her childhood.
p363_282,Other people had looked at it.
p363_283,And the other winners are.
p363_284,It was quite a sight.
p363_285,But he was far from alone.
p363_286,We have got no money to go anywhere.
p363_287,I believe he could have turned it around.
p363_288,The Believer isn't just a movie.
p363_289,You are looking at him.
p363_290,The best team won.
p363_291,"It being the weekend, there was no-one there."
p363_292,It was an achievement all right.
p363_293,They think that it matters but it doesn't.
p363_294,He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p363_295,It should be equal.
p363_296,It will make a big difference.
p363_297,I want to make a difference.
p363_298,What was the cause of all this outrage?
p363_299,He will have it within two weeks.
p363_300,How do you feel?
p363_301,It is a terrible state of affairs.
p363_302,It was not the right time for me.
p363_303,But they have the sound.
p363_304,Not all women are dismayed.
p363_305,There will have to be a full inquiry.
p363_306,It is not just in Edinburgh.
p363_307,It's never happened before.
p363_308,It was a deeper deception.
p363_309,Norton was delighted with his successes.
p363_310,"The figures are bad, but not that bad."
p363_311,There is another side to it.
p363_312,His remit is specific.
p363_313,It will be very damaging for research.
p363_314,I'm a bit overwhelmed.
p363_315,The Old Firm are growing.
p363_316,They want to win the title.
p363_317,Her concerns were not without foundation.
p363_318,This decision is a farce.
p363_319,That would be the constructive way forward.
p363_320,My view has now completely changed.
p363_321,It was blown out of proportion.
p363_322,You have no chance of planning permission.
p363_323,That is taking place in Strathclyde.
p363_324,He was in a mood.
p363_325,Was this element always there?
p363_326,This is an awful lot of money.
p363_327,He was the architect.
p363_328,The United Nations must act.
p363_329,They haven't got a hope.
p363_330,He was a national treasure.
p363_331,I think they are right to be impatient.
p363_332,We need to regroup.
p363_333,I must make that clear.
p363_334,The board is currently resolving its differences.
p363_335,I've never regretted coming here.
p363_336,"He is in a lot of pain, it is very distressing."
p363_337,I just had to go for it.
p363_338,It seems to go down well.
p363_339,I am feeling on top of the world.
p363_341,"I don't know, really."
p363_343,Therefore there is a threat.
p363_344,She would love it.
p363_345,One was taken to hospital.
p363_346,You did not see it.
p363_347,Gritty he did not want.
p363_348,The world is being invited to visit.
p363_349,Nobody was able to escape.
p363_350,Surely the answer is yes.
p363_351,"Secondly, there is the question of money."
p363_352,He was later deported.
p363_353,I only found out about it this morning.
p363_354,I am not sure.
p363_355,One might think that it is a power.
p363_356,This place is outstanding.
p363_357,Obviously we want to stop the rot.
p363_358,But it is a fact.
p363_359,They never seem to do anything about it.
p363_360,We're going to sleep.
p363_361,It raises a serious question mark.
p363_362,The work with Alison was a great experience.
p363_363,It was great fun.
p363_364,Experience in this work is paramount.
p363_365,It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
p363_366,"It is not needed, it should go."
p363_367,She had not suffered any physical injury.
p363_368,We have a business to run.
p363_369,We have been overwhelmed by the response.
p363_370,And there are others.
p363_371,"However, it was well worth the wait."
p363_372,I think we did well.
p363_373,Only two things are certain.
p363_374,There is nothing to fear.
p363_375,Just look at his record.
p363_376,He was a legend.
p363_377,It is a memorial.
p363_378,I have no evidence.
p363_379,But is he?
p363_380,We were very unhappy with the incident.
p363_381,The challenge is to win a cup.
p363_382,It is something that we would support.
p363_383,It was a double tragedy for the family.
p363_384,We are in shock.
p363_385,Does it really matter?
p363_386,I loved it - and so did my friend.
p363_387,A decision is expected today.
p363_388,I am enjoying it.
p363_389,It wasn't very pretty to watch.
p363_390,You have to go for it.
p363_391,Are these immoral?
p363_392,It has been a massive success.
p363_393,It is for the same reason.
p363_394,The whole thing has been a nightmare.
p363_395,Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p363_396,He will have something to say.
p363_397,You can't take a chance.
p363_398,I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
p363_399,There is a lack of logic.
p363_401,We are about to have our own Parliament.
p363_402,I am desperate to play for Scotland.
p363_403,It is a large number.
p363_404,She doesn't know where to begin.
p363_405,This is your chance.
p363_406,I'm not allowed to speak to anyone.
p363_407,There's nothing she can't do.
p363_408,Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.
p363_409,I'd love the chance to play for Scotland.
p363_410,Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
p363_411,He died in September.
p363_412,It was not even this century.
p363_413,That was really tough.
p363_414,It's not going to last five minutes.
p363_415,I am happy with my form.
p363_416,"That's the name of the game, though."
p363_417,With him are the symbols of his faith.
p363_418,"Overall, it has certainly worked out."
p363_419,This is actually true.
p363_420,Both were reduced to rubble.
p363_421,It could have taken another two months.
p363_422,"Hopefully, the answer is in the positive."
p363_423,He said he had no reports of casualties.
