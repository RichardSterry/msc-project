p316_001,Please call Stella.
p316_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p316_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p316_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p316_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p316_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p316_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p316_008,"These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p316_009,"There is , according to a legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p316_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p316_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p316_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p316_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p316_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p316_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p316_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p316_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p316_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p316_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but the refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p316_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p316_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase."
p316_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p316_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p316_025,"We have to pull together, or we will hang apart."
p316_026,Meetings will also remain private.
p316_027,Have we tried everything?
p316_028,It's not going to work out that way.
p316_029,We have worked hard.
p316_030,"After that, it's a step into the unknown."
p316_031,"Naturally, she said yes."
p316_032,This is not a war on terror.
p316_033,It is not for any other purpose.
p316_034,There will always be problems on the way.
p316_035,Why you did it will never be known.
p316_036,He was in his element.
p316_037,She is believed to be in South Africa.
p316_038,What a week he has had.
p316_039,We just want this season to end.
p316_040,He is looking for a sporting challenge.
p316_041,There is a new confidence about the club.
p316_042,"I accept that, but is very upsetting."
p316_043,We accept the challenge.
p316_044,"The question is, Will it be enough?"
p316_045,After that it is up to the boss.
p316_046,They were taken to prove a point.
p316_047,It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
p316_048,And they removed a Borderer.
p316_049,"So, why does he do it?"
p316_050,I would love to have him home.
p316_051,"It is very unfair, and something should be done."
p316_052,He had no enemies.
p316_053,That is not the case this time.
p316_054,We are going to New Broomfield to win.
p316_055,But the law is very clear on this.
p316_056,They treated me with respect and courtesy.
p316_057,There was only silence.
p316_058,"However, he said it would be likely to bring a chill."
p316_059,It doesn't look as pretty.
p316_060,"However, our players will fight for that."
p316_061,Everyone was very saddened.
p316_062,He declined to give further details.
p316_063,He said it was for sale.
p316_064,This is a dream come true.
p316_065,The problem is not confined to the UK.
p316_066,I wouldn't give them a grade.
p316_067,What on earth is wrong with you?
p316_068,This is far too high.
p316_069,We are still going ahead with our plans.
p316_070,IS Tony Blair on drugs?
p316_071,And if he hadn't become a musician?
p316_072,It has certainly paid off for him.
p316_073,He was also a great man.
p316_074,We have a major concern about the enforcement action.
p316_075,It is clear that change is required.
p316_076,Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
p316_077,This is a big step up.
p316_078,Robin Williams is subdued.
p316_079,The judge was very nice.
p316_080,They control the prices paid to farmers.
p316_081,The company yesterday refused to comment.
p316_082,Most of them have already gone home.
p316_083,"Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red."
p316_084,"Weaknesses there are, however."
p316_085,"It is, after all, a very funny play."
p316_086,Can you imagine a world without design?
p316_087,He was caught and fired.
p316_088,I feel confident about the outcome.
p316_089,The driver escaped injury.
p316_090,Mini rugby is a great thing.
p316_091,There was no bad behaviour.
p316_092,Today she has been released.
p316_093,It's a much bigger problem.
p316_094,There are no problems between us at all.
p316_095,"Hopefully, he will be back in contention next week."
p316_096,I've had it for the exams.
p316_097,I hope it comes out all right.
p316_098,I will just have to be patient.
p316_099,It's a sensible management decision.
p316_100,I kept it very simple.
p316_101,The rest was badminton.
p316_102,It will take several days.
p316_103,We had to push to get a goal.
p316_104,That got me out.
p316_105,I would just like someone to confess.
p316_106,We are making progress on waiting lists.
p316_107,It will have to ratify the deal.
p316_108,I did not have faith in the procedures.
p316_109,I was not a joiner.
p316_110,It has to find out what went wrong.
p316_111,Until you hit the big games.
p316_112,It has until Saturday.
p316_113,I've tried to get on with my life.
p316_114,She has the biggest part.
p316_115,We will win this tie.
p316_116,This is totally untrue.
p316_117,Or someone wants to say something different.
p316_118,I think they have to change that.
p316_119,This series is for real.
p316_120,"It's great news, isn't it."
p316_121,It's very ingenious.
p316_122,That would depend on the parole board.
p316_123,It is all up to the Members.
p316_124,The two sets are different.
p316_125,And now the pressure is off.
p316_126,You can see the appeal of running away.
p316_127,Their opening was disastrous.
p316_128,The time is up for Iraq to comply.
p316_129,There can be no compromise on that demand.
p316_130,The following are the principal provisions.
p316_131,Too much has already been said.
p316_132,"Now, however, things are different."
p316_133,"It was not a beautiful game, was it?"
p316_134,She is not the world champion.
p316_135,It would be difficult to argue with that.
p316_136,"While they went on a holiday, we got the contract."
p316_137,He is a bully.
p316_138,The case was taken on by his brother.
p316_139,I've won the British.
p316_140,And so the cycle continues.
p316_141,I don't have many friends.
p316_142,"However, it was a different story in the final."
p316_143,They exist in name alone.
p316_144,I am not retiring.
p316_145,All will be revealed in due course.
p316_146,"In the current outbreak, the reverse is true."
p316_147,"And frankly, it's been a while."
p316_148,Feel for five seconds.
p316_149,I hope it is a good omen.
p316_150,"Because if it matters to them, it matters to me."
p316_151,They will appear again next week.
p316_152,Failure is not an option.
p316_153,We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
p316_154,You look at that.
p316_155,Things begin to spring to life.
p316_156,Or was it Some kind of a ham?
p316_157,I understood that concern.
p316_158,The things writers and directors say!
p316_159,I am prepared to step down.
p316_160,It was like a dream to be here.
p316_161,The four characters could be one somebody suggested.
p316_162,"Either way, it doesn't bother me."
p316_163,It would help to heal the wounds.
p316_164,We did not deserve to go through.
p316_165,It's got to be in the head.
p316_166,It certainly sounded it at times.
p316_167,It will be too hot.
p316_168,That happens in boxing.
p316_169,Consumers will also benefit.
p316_170,None of the opinions is good.
p316_171,We were hopeful that it would be successful.
p316_172,They must not succeed.
p316_173,He declined to provide a breakdown.
p316_174,But the foundations have been laid.
p316_175,I have never seen him like that.
p316_176,And you need to be so resourceful.
p316_177,"Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarerry."
p316_178,She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p316_179,Everything in the world was focused on London.
p316_180,We played better after the break.
p316_181,But this relative success has not been easy.
p316_182,It was the same with the Dickens.
p316_183,Of course it is still possible.
p316_184,"Actually, it's an amazing orchestra."
p316_185,"That, in a way, is the point."
p316_186,What is so unusual about this case?
p316_187,"It is not about the money, it is about everything."
p316_188,That would end it for us.
p316_189,Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
p316_190,"Sure, he is the best player in the world."
p316_191,I just love lessons.
p316_192,Retirement is on his mind.
p316_193,It's to do with this place.
p316_194,The home side didn't stand a chance.
p316_195,We shall not be moved.
p316_196,The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p316_197,It is not just the agencies.
p316_198,There must be boundaries.
p316_199,"However, he was later released without charge."
p316_200,Arsenal refused to be evicted.
p316_201,I watch the other visitors.
p316_202,Nobody is pushing out to the right.
p316_204,He confirmed his fitness.
p316_205,The gap is narrowing.
p316_206,All of us in Scotland should be viligant.
p316_207,Both men were uninjured.
p316_208,My husband was fighting for his life.
p316_209,It is not a financial issue.
p316_210,We are in this for the long haul.
p316_211,We have a budget in March.
p316_212,There was no respite.
p316_213,"I got very, very tired."
p316_214,I am really sorry that he is going.
p316_215,They will do their own thing.
p316_216,It is too much for me.
p316_217,But is this enough to provoke a killing?
p316_218,I didn't just walk in and get it.
p316_219,We've made a couple of albums.
p316_220,We need a much wider debate.
p316_221,My attitude is exactly the same as before.
p316_222,Look at a computer.
p316_223,They went back to the seventeenth.
p316_224,"First, the programme was unbalanced."
p316_225,So what could be better than becoming a captain?
p316_226,"However, it proved to be the turning point."
p316_227,"However, everyone should do it once in their life."
p316_228,"In hindsight, it was the wrong decision."
p316_229,I waited and waited.
p316_230,We all knew it could not be true.
p316_231,Its future is uncertain.
p316_232,I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
p316_233,It doesn't look good for her.
p316_234,She said he did not look too happy.
p316_235,We are aware of the problem.
p316_236,Where will the elderly go then?
p316_237,Then it was changed without notice.
p316_238,He had a great game.
p316_239,"The following year, they asked him again."
p316_240,It is the men who create the demand.
p316_241,I'm very happy indeed to be almost redundant.
p316_242,Every case is completely different.
p316_243,"It's a scandal, a disgrace."
p316_244,Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
p316_245,"However, he said the money had not been wasted."
p316_246,It will be fine.
p316_247,He should emerge as the winner.
p316_248,"They are you, the fans."
p316_249,We're just waiting for her reaction.
p316_250,"At the end of the day, two men have been shot."
p316_251,What a difference a game can make.
p316_252,"They will not be able to come back, in my opinion."
p316_253,Why do it?
p316_254,It opened last month.
p316_255,This will be our new beginning.
p316_256,"If they don't, they might well decide not to play."
p316_257,I have totally had enough.
p316_258,Hopefully today will be the turning point.
p316_259,We shall be ready for Rangers.
p316_260,"It was bound to happen, and it has happened."
p316_261,There were no reported casualties on the ground.
p316_262,What are you waiting for?
p316_263,"In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court."
p316_264,This is still happening in the US.
p316_265,Another issue will be policing.
p316_266,Today was first class.
p316_267,This is the biggest surprise of my life.
p316_268,"On the contrary, it was actually very funny."
p316_269,This is a good move for me.
p316_270,Feel the heat?
p316_271,She was so full of life.
p316_272,I should have given him one in return.
p316_273,I began to pray.
p316_274,The princess has strong links with Scotland.
p316_275,I am very confident about tomorrow night.
p316_276,I just wanted to fly.
p316_277,And he has a tale to tell.
p316_278,Footballers have also been targeted.
p316_279,The deadline is real and absolute.
p316_280,"So, how did this happen?"
p316_281,It's all a part of letting it go.
p316_282,I just hope it's not tonight against us.
p316_283,There are no quick fixes.
p316_284,The change was not instant.
p316_285,We've got the bronze.
p316_286,They use them for everything.
p316_287,Who is to benefit from this change?
p316_288,We are not defeated.
p316_289,He knows what he's got to do.
p316_290,"Clearly, the stakes are high."
p316_291,We have been going for three years.
p316_292,We deserved the three points.
p316_293,It is planned for London in the spring.
p316_294,War and force are not the only solutions.
p316_295,They would have to go to the Royal.
p316_296,It didn't matter who was in their way.
p316_297,Which brings us to the point.
p316_298,I think it's difficult for Bonnie.
p316_299,I am quite excited about it.
p316_300,Everyone agrees with that.
p316_301,She had denied the charge.
p316_302,"If we live forever, can we really be said to live?"
p316_303,Sometimes you stand on them as they collapse.
p316_304,I didn't feel good.
p316_305,It is believed that he had been stabbed.
p316_306,It is an expensive part of their equipment.
p316_307,Let's get to know him.
p316_308,We have got to attack.
p316_309,"Well, they were the unlucky ones."
p316_310,Time has run out for Saddam Hussein.
p316_311,It divided audiences at Cannes.
p316_312,"It's a lovely, lovely film."
p316_313,How would it work?
p316_314,We told them in July.
p316_315,The film was great.
p316_316,Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p316_317,It's a real challenge.
p316_318,The police believe that the man was not injured.
p316_319,Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
p316_320,There was too much at stake.
p316_321,I read about it in the newspapers.
p316_322,What did they think of her voice?
p316_323,Is that not uncanny?
p316_324,It has to reinvent itself.
p316_325,It is a good result for Great Britain.
p316_326,He was happy with his form.
p316_327,His art was not just about emotions.
p316_328,Nato was not a love affair.
p316_329,It's a production company.
p316_330,But we will not be scared.
p316_331,But that is not an issue for now.
p316_332,It will not work in our favour.
p316_333,It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p316_334,He is on the wrong side.
p316_335,That was a disgraceful performance.
p316_336,There will be no receivers.
p316_337,My son was too young to die.
p316_338,The air campaign is not over yet.
p316_339,It's a national sport.
p316_340,But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
p316_341,"The picture in Glasgow was improving, he added."
p316_342,Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
p316_343,I was shocked and outraged.
p316_344,Not many people like to do that.
p316_345,It was extremely cold.
p316_346,Italy would be lukewarm.
p316_347,People are using it in their daily lives.
p316_348,Chelsea was a great club.
p316_349,We have to open up.
p316_350,She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p316_351,There is a review outgoing at the moment.
p316_352,The pensioners did not want to know.
p316_353,It was just awful.
p316_354,We are doing okay in the league.
p316_355,Today the Kremlin would be contacted in seconds.
p316_356,It is time for concerted national action.
p316_357,Do you know who we are?
p316_358,Souter will be back.
p316_359,I'd like to report a murder.
p316_360,I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p316_361,It certainly gives you hope.
p316_362,"If he does not leave, he will be shot."
p316_363,Two people have died.
p316_364,Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
p316_365,I am delighted to have her back home.
p316_366,Many of them were his friends and colleagues.
p316_367,It is based on his movement records.
p316_368,It wasn't an easy decision.
p316_369,It left me with sadness.
p316_370,There is a changing of the guard.
p316_371,The boys are very confident.
p316_372,It was our time maybe.
p316_373,I know we can play a lot better.
p316_374,We said it will happen one night.
p316_375,It is a flexible concept.
p316_376,This election is far from over.
p316_377,So the Government will be damaged.
p316_378,"Ali was shot at, but refused to back down."
p316_379,"However, we let them back into the game."
p316_380,I have great confidence in Annabelle.
p316_381,Is that such a bad thing?
p316_382,You do need a check and a balance.
p316_383,Thousands of people were missing.
p316_384,Maloney is an engaging talent.
p316_385,It's time to move on.
p316_386,I couldn't get out of bed.
p316_387,Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p316_388,"I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant."
p316_389,I can't describe it.
p316_390,It changed my life.
p316_391,But what will we put on it?
p316_392,It will benefit a lot of people.
p316_393,A new school will be built.
p316_394,"There may be hope this year, however."
p316_395,That is not too bad.
p316_396,They are taking a stand against this.
p316_397,They are not left wing.
p316_398,I was the sheep.
p316_399,I think we believed the tie was won.
p316_400,"Well, there you go."
p316_401,How do you find the youngsters?
p316_402,It was a great team effort.
p316_403,"In my experience, he does not do that."
p316_404,Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
p316_405,I am glad that justice has been done.
p316_406,Its first awards will just do that.
p316_407,The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p316_408,That is my preference.
p316_409,Taxation should be simplified.
p316_410,We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p316_411,It is not that sort of inquiry.
p316_412,I have signed a contract.
p316_413,I have never been overly ambitious.
p316_414,We were beaten by the better team.
p316_415,I hope you don't regret it.
p316_416,He was all blackened.
p316_417,This is your country.
p316_418,This is the greatest moment of our lives.
p316_419,Audiences there were shocked.
p316_420,They responded in the most positive way.
p316_421,The British government said she was coming home.
p316_422,We won very easily.
p316_423,That is a matter for Mr Graham.
