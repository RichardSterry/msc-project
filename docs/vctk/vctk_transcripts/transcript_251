p251_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p251_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p251_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p251_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p251_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p251_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p251_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p251_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p251_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p251_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p251_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p251_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p251_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p251_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p251_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p251_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p251_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p251_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p251_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p251_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p251_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p251_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p251_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p251_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p251_025,"Johnson was pretty low.
"
p251_026,"But it failed.
"
p251_027,"That's no bad thing.
"
p251_028,"People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
"
p251_029,"However, the following year the cancer returned.
"
p251_030,"So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
"
p251_032,"It's a matter of balance.
"
p251_033,"Peace was won.
"
p251_034,"Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
"
p251_035,"They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
"
p251_036,"Was it worth it?
"
p251_037,"At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
"
p251_038,"However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
"
p251_039,"In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
"
p251_040,"It was clear.
"
p251_041,"They may be wrong.
"
p251_042,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p251_043,"Dancing was her life.
"
p251_044,"We will push.
"
p251_045,"I feel pretty good.
"
p251_046,"That should do it.
"
p251_047,"Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
"
p251_048,"As she explains.
"
p251_049,"Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
"
p251_050,"It is the whole package.
"
p251_051,"He had no enemies.
"
p251_052,"I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
"
p251_053,"We were surprised to see the photograph.
"
p251_054,"I had relied on him.
"
p251_055,"This is a step backwards.
"
p251_056,"Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
"
p251_057,"What was the main difference?
"
p251_058,"Four other charges were dropped.
"
p251_059,"It's a real challenge.
"
p251_060,"It is not great art.
"
p251_061,"They're appalled by that.
"
p251_062,"It's that kind of place.
"
p251_063,"It was all in a short period of time.
"
p251_064,"An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
"
p251_065,"And if he hadn't become a musician?
"
p251_066,"He was popular.
"
p251_067,"He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
"
p251_068,"That was the easy election.
"
p251_069,"There could be a way back.
"
p251_070,"They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
"
p251_071,"IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
"
p251_072,"It was chaotic.
"
p251_073,"It is a time bomb.
"
p251_074,"I've not thought about it.
"
p251_075,"Today she has been released.
"
p251_076,"It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
"
p251_077,"That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
"
p251_078,"I was too young.
"
p251_079,"The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
"
p251_080,"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
"
p251_081,"War is not the action.
"
p251_082,"You will be.
"
p251_083,"Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
"
p251_084,"Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
"
p251_085,"We have turned the corner.
"
p251_087,"Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
"
p251_088,"They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
"
p251_089,"We must look forward.
"
p251_090,"It is an old family habit.
"
p251_091,"Until you hit the big games.
"
p251_092,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p251_093,"The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
"
p251_094,"If you could find it.
"
p251_095,"Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
"
p251_096,"Journalists should make him.
"
p251_097,"They were outside the circle.
"
p251_098,"Two of the team became ill.
"
p251_099,"That would be unlawful.
"
p251_100,"No date has been set for the appeal.
"
p251_101,"It is a good lifestyle.
"
p251_102,"That is no use.
"
p251_103,"They had to be cut from the wreckage.
"
p251_104,"Further protests are likely.
"
p251_105,"I was fighting for my life, I thought.
"
p251_106,"He was jailed for a year.
"
p251_107,"It had been played at festivals.
"
p251_108,"I came to complete.
"
p251_109,"You had better believe it.
"
p251_110,"I was angry.
"
p251_111,"The fire was above the hole.
"
p251_112,"This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
"
p251_113,"We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
"
p251_114,"It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
"
p251_115,"Maybe this battle has been.
"
p251_116,"I joined a group.
"
p251_117,"Does this mean.
"
p251_118,"It is rubbish.
"
p251_119,"This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
"
p251_120,"We work on the same level.
"
p251_121,"We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
"
p251_122,"She has been shot.
"
p251_123,"I'm so angry.
"
p251_124,"It's terrible that he has died the same way.
"
p251_125,"Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
"
p251_126,"Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
"
p251_127,"Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
"
p251_128,"Well, you can have a tree.
"
p251_129,"It was the same at Twickenham.
"
p251_130,"We had a reunion last week.
"
p251_131,"If not, a deal could take many months.
"
p251_132,"Government will intervene.
"
p251_133,"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
"
p251_134,"Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
"
p251_135,"Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
"
p251_136,"Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
"
p251_137,"We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
"
p251_138,"Is that it?
"
p251_139,"I had decided to quit the show.
"
p251_140,"I am totally devoted to this job.
"
p251_141,"Three penalties were given.
"
p251_142,"And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
"
p251_143,"We just had a go.
"
p251_144,"We have seen a copy of the report.
"
p251_145,"The songs are just so good.
"
p251_146,"It is like a football team.
"
p251_147,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p251_148,"He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
"
p251_149,"You know the type.
"
p251_150,"The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
"
p251_151,"But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
"
p251_152,"He seemed to lose his focus.
"
p251_153,"It is not normal practice.
"
p251_154,"There's a sense of excess in the novel.
"
p251_155,"I knew he was good.
"
p251_156,"I saw one body.
"
p251_157,"There's a pause.
"
p251_158,"Neither side can win this war.
"
p251_159,"Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
"
p251_160,"I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
"
p251_161,"Eight months later, he was dead.
"
p251_162,"We have to move forward.
"
p251_163,"However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
"
p251_164,"Tell it like it was?
"
p251_165,"It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
"
p251_166,"By then, however, both men were already in the US.
"
p251_167,"You are not going in blind.
"
p251_168,"The post will be unpaid.
"
p251_169,"Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
"
p251_170,"They thought they had found a home.
"
p251_171,"I always felt they played for me.
"
p251_172,"Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
"
p251_173,"One season, they might do well.
"
p251_174,"The jury is still out.
"
p251_175,"We wanted it left for a wee while.
"
p251_176,"It is not either national standards or local control.
"
p251_177,"The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
"
p251_178,"We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
"
p251_179,"I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
"
p251_180,"We knew nothing about it.
"
p251_181,"Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
"
p251_182,"Four policemen were wounded.
"
p251_183,"We did everything by the book.
"
p251_184,"What has caused the demise of singing?
"
p251_185,"We want to help them through it.
"
p251_186,"I cannot say too much about them.
"
p251_187,"It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
"
p251_188,"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
"
p251_189,"People will ask about us.
"
p251_190,"However, this idea is never developed.
"
p251_191,"Last night was a key episode.
"
p251_192,"We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
"
p251_193,"The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
"
p251_194,"Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
"
p251_195,"It is a case of taking a risk.
"
p251_196,"It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
"
p251_197,"It wasn't to be.
"
p251_198,"It was typical.
"
p251_199,"It's the same old story.
"
p251_200,"The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
"
p251_201,"It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
"
p251_202,"There was no option.
"
p251_203,"The conference is the first test.
"
p251_204,"I saw some terrible things.
"
p251_205,"They've got three-quarters of the way.
"
p251_206,"A deadline is still essential.
"
p251_207,"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
"
p251_208,"We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
"
p251_209,"Today was first class.
"
p251_210,"Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
"
p251_211,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p251_212,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p251_213,"Now, it's all right.
"
p251_214,"There was an e-mail.
"
p251_215,"Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
"
p251_216,"Twaddle is a case in point.
"
p251_217,"I began to pray.
"
p251_218,"A Grampian Police spokesman said.
"
p251_219,"We have got to get it right.
"
p251_220,"The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
"
p251_221,"A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
"
p251_222,"Work has started.
"
p251_223,"For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
"
p251_224,"It's just a place to open it.
"
p251_225,"Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
"
p251_226,"The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
"
p251_227,"IT S the real thing, for sure.
"
p251_228,"Women were mostly notable by their absence.
"
p251_230,"At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
"
p251_231,"We played them off the pitch.
"
p251_232,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p251_233,"It's a question of creating a future awareness.
"
p251_234,"I am immensely sad.
"
p251_235,"I'd never seen a play about me.
"
p251_236,"It is a gamble.
"
p251_237,"But he failed to win the committee's support.
"
p251_238,"Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
"
p251_239,"We were awful.
"
p251_240,"However, no further action was taken by police.
"
p251_241,"Police later said the scheme would end in November.
"
p251_242,"They had no children.
"
p251_243,"It is set in Paris.
"
p251_244,"They should come forward.
"
p251_245,"It's quite a line-up!
"
p251_246,"I think a move would create a lot of interest.
"
p251_247,"It would still have been a good film, but very different.
"
p251_248,"The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
"
p251_249,"Of further privacy, he had no need.
"
p251_250,"My future is in the marathon.
"
p251_251,"The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
"
p251_252,"We have a free vote on these things in our party.
"
p251_253,"He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
"
p251_254,"The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
"
p251_255,"It is hard won.
"
p251_256,"We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
"
p251_257,"Chambers said he would accept the place.
"
p251_258,"Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
"
p251_259,"They tried to give her advice.
"
p251_260,"His body was never found.
"
p251_262,"He's a lovely young man.
"
p251_263,"It was a hit.
"
p251_264,"We are ready.
"
p251_265,"They know no other way.
"
p251_266,"I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
"
p251_267,"We run within the law.
"
p251_268,"They are interior designers and architects.
"
p251_269,"Kirkwood was arrested.
"
p251_270,"they fail to engage.
"
p251_271,"One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
"
p251_272,"So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
"
p251_273,"I was happily surprised.
"
p251_274,"Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
"
p251_275,"I am very angry.
"
p251_276,"Today we can say that a new era has begun.
"
p251_278,"This court has made an order which has not been observed.
"
p251_279,"Rehearsals will start in the new year for the extended season.
"
p251_280,"He thought he had a month to cross the street.
"
p251_281,"Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
"
p251_282,"That's the only thing I will say.
"
p251_283,"That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
"
p251_284,"It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
"
p251_285,"The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
"
p251_286,"He has not created a Festival resource.
"
p251_287,"Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
"
p251_288,"Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
"
p251_289,"We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
"
p251_290,"It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
"
p251_291,"We're in shock.
"
p251_292,"Our objective is to tackle poverty.
"
p251_293,"One knows the feeling.
"
p251_294,"Things can change.
"
p251_295,"It's a way of life.
"
p251_296,"A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
"
p251_297,"I am an estate agent.
"
p251_298,"People have no choice.
"
p251_299,"She looked so young.
"
p251_300,"It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
"
p251_301,"Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
"
p251_302,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p251_303,"Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
"
p251_304,"You've got to have both sides.
"
p251_305,"What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
"
p251_306,"Who will perform?
"
p251_307,"This is a national crisis.
"
p251_308,"Scotland were beaten again.
"
p251_309,"Who did the recruiting?
"
p251_310,"She said she could not believe that they had run away.
"
p251_311,"For the moment, our position remains the same.
"
p251_312,"The results are sometimes contentious.
"
p251_313,"These figures are truly awful.
"
p251_314,"But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
"
p251_315,"A new school will be built.
"
p251_316,"Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
"
p251_317,"We have to sort it out ourselves.
"
p251_318,"He said she was mad.
"
p251_319,"He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
"
p251_320,"Our task is to complete the picture.
"
p251_321,"Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
"
p251_322,"We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
"
p251_323,"It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
"
p251_324,"You are the glory.
"
p251_325,"The letters are going out today.
"
p251_326,"In fact, they have the opposite effect.
"
p251_327,"We are a peaceful people.
"
p251_328,"Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
"
p251_329,"It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
"
p251_330,"It is out there.
"
p251_331,"They had a confession.
"
p251_332,"However, the groups denied the claims.
"
p251_333,"That is a trend which will be encouraged.
"
p251_334,"That's the law of the land.
"
p251_335,"There was no time scale.
"
p251_336,"In his absence, the council adopted the change.
"
p251_337,"It's not long enough.
"
p251_338,"I am so upset.
"
p251_339,"He was not a big name.
"
p251_340,"The police have to act to help them.
"
p251_341,"It could have gone either way.
"
p251_342,"Is that an issue?
"
p251_343,"He can do no wrong.
"
p251_344,"Finally, he paid for the movie.
"
p251_345,"You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
"
p251_346,"In Scotland, we keep the faith.
"
p251_347,"The team for the first game could be this one.
"
p251_348,"The same things will happen with GM foods.
"
p251_349,"The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
"
p251_350,"He did a good job.
"
p251_351,"We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
"
p251_352,"Well, it won't.
"
p251_353,"But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
"
p251_355,"I'm very lucky.
"
p251_356,"In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
"
