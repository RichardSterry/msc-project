p306_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p306_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p306_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p306_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its paths high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p306_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p306_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p306_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."

p306_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p306_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.

p306_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p306_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p306_019,"Since then physicists have found that is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p306_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p306_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p306_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p306_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p306_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
