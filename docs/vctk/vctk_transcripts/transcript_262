p262_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p262_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p262_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p262_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p262_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p262_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p262_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p262_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p262_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p262_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p262_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p262_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p262_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p262_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p262_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p262_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p262_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p262_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p262_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p262_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p262_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p262_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p262_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p262_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p262_025,"The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
"
p262_026,"They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
"
p262_027,"However, the following year the cancer returned.
"
p262_028,"Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
"
p262_029,"We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
"
p262_030,"They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
"
p262_031,"I expected these kind of questions.
"
p262_032,"This is the window.
"
p262_033,"People love to see this stuff.
"
p262_034,"Life was like a timetable.
"
p262_035,"Then, suddenly, they weren't.
"
p262_036,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p262_037,"It was clear.
"
p262_038,"The problem is the pitch.
"
p262_039,"It was ugly.
"
p262_040,"However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
"
p262_041,"Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
"
p262_042,"The judge said.
"
p262_043,"It's a crucial award.
"
p262_044,"It is difficult for Ali.
"
p262_045,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p262_046,"I was angry.
"
p262_047,"It has been a horrible, horrible time.
"
p262_048,"They had to explain it.
"
p262_049,"He had no enemies.
"
p262_050,"We were surprised to see the photograph.
"
p262_051,"Next league matches Celtic.
"
p262_052,"There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
"
p262_053,"It's very odd.
"
p262_054,"Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
"
p262_055,"It's not pretty, but it's effective.
"
p262_056,"This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
"
p262_057,"New York is expected to come to a standstill.
"
p262_058,"Jobs could go.
"
p262_059,"And a film maker was born.
"
p262_060,"I fell against him.
"
p262_061,"There was a battle there.
"
p262_062,"There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
"
p262_063,"And if he hadn't become a musician?
"
p262_064,"He was popular.
"
p262_065,"Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
"
p262_066,"It is like a river running by my home.
"
p262_067,"I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
"
p262_068,"It's all I can do.
"
p262_069,"He highlighted a lack of staff.
"
p262_070,"Then followed a bout of flu.
"
p262_071,"The girls are so lucky to be alive.
"
p262_072,"I had my suspicions.
"
p262_073,"I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
"
p262_074,"I've not thought about it.
"
p262_075,"What has changed?
"
p262_076,"I'd like to continue that record.
"
p262_077,"Detection is often difficult.
"
p262_078,"He is driven.
"
p262_079,"All options are open.
"
p262_080,"Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
"
p262_081,"Someone who cares
"
p262_082,"It's never too late.
"
p262_083,"Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
"
p262_084,"That will come after the game on Saturday.
"
p262_085,"Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
"
p262_086,"Today I couldn't run on it.
"
p262_087,"Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
"
p262_088,"This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
"
p262_089,"That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
"
p262_090,"Then came the crunch.
"
p262_091,"The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
"
p262_092,"They are now divorced.
"
p262_093,"I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
"
p262_094,"Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
"
p262_095,"FOR once, you should believe the hype.
"
p262_096,"Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
"
p262_097,"It is a good day for the coalition.
"
p262_098,"However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
"
p262_099,"Two of the team became ill.
"
p262_100,"Oil embargo endorsed.
"
p262_101,"It is a good lifestyle.
"
p262_102,"It was an adventure.
"
p262_103,"It's not perfect.
"
p262_104,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p262_105,"He pleaded for caution.
"
p262_106,"They are ready.
"
p262_107,"It's a shame.
"
p262_108,"Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
"
p262_109,"Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
"
p262_110,"They were behind the wheel.
"
p262_111,"This film will be totally awesome.
"
p262_112,"Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
"
p262_113,"Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
"
p262_114,"They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
"
p262_115,"That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
"
p262_116,"Who would have?
"
p262_117,"The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
"
p262_118,"I felt very strongly that England should have it.
"
p262_119,"Next season for every manager is a long time away.
"
p262_120,"They keep the atmosphere in mind.
"
p262_121,"So the European elections are extremely important.
"
p262_122,"It was the same at Twickenham.
"
p262_123,"It plans to return to this field.
"
p262_124,"Our intentions are real.
"
p262_125,"The goals were good.
"
p262_126,"Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
"
p262_127,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p262_128,"Nobody in the world can get away from him.
"
p262_129,"It's a question of fashion.
"
p262_130,"It seems so long since I did the exams.
"
p262_131,"Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
"
p262_132,"We need to chat.
"
p262_133,"She died at her home.
"
p262_134,"I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
"
p262_135,"It would be a last resort.
"
p262_136,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p262_137,"Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
"
p262_138,"It opens the door to the Champions League.
"
p262_139,"It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
"
p262_140,"It is huge.
"
p262_141,"I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
"
p262_142,"Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
"
p262_143,"Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
"
p262_144,"Mr Blair had done well.
"
p262_145,"We also enjoyed a lot of support.
"
p262_146,"We should be clear about the role of government.
"
p262_147,"It is a freedom.
"
p262_148,"It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
"
p262_149,"I knew he was good.
"
p262_150,"They were later discharged from hospital.
"
p262_151,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p262_152,"Neither side can win this war.
"
p262_153,"He can do no wrong.
"
p262_154,"Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
"
p262_155,"A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
"
p262_156,"He's been the key to everything.
"
p262_157,"Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
"
p262_158,"They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
"
p262_159,"As, indeed, they would be.
"
p262_160,"They are not advertised.
"
p262_161,"We knew we had the goal we wanted.
"
p262_162,"However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
"
p262_163,"It's that sort of night.
"
p262_164,"It is not too late to get on board.
"
p262_165,"It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
"
p262_166,"We have a budget in March.
"
p262_167,"Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
"
p262_168,"The post will be unpaid.
"
p262_169,"Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
"
p262_170,"It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
"
p262_171,"We've made a couple of albums.
"
p262_172,"They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
"
p262_173,"Is Saddam a threat?
"
p262_174,"I feel like my game has come a long way.
"
p262_175,"We wanted it left for a wee while.
"
p262_176,"The clarity is vital.
"
p262_177,"Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
"
p262_178,"There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
"
p262_179,"That has been the easy part.
"
p262_180,"He will need that machine.
"
p262_181,"Nothing is safe.
"
p262_182,"And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
"
p262_183,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p262_184,"Miller was every bit as happy.
"
p262_185,"I had a train to catch.
"
p262_186,"That would be my view.
"
p262_187,"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
"
p262_188,"Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
"
p262_189,"We must keep our feet on the ground.
"
p262_190,"It wasn't to be.
"
p262_191,"I came home by ambulance.
"
p262_192,"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
"
p262_193,"Our strategy is straightforward.
"
p262_194,"The group is separate from the Real IRA.
"
p262_195,"People acted too quickly.
"
p262_196,"The service from the other players was super.
"
p262_197,"He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
"
p262_198,"He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
"
p262_199,"Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
"
p262_200,"On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
"
p262_201,"They are in the euro.
"
p262_202,"The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
"
p262_203,"It's all about money, money, money.
"
p262_204,"There was no rescue.
"
p262_205,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p262_206,"But I am a worried man.
"
p262_207,"There was an e-mail.
"
p262_208,"It's a big deal for me.
"
p262_209,"We'll have to work hard today.
"
p262_210,"The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
"
p262_211,"I had decided to quit the show.
"
p262_212,"The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
"
p262_213,"I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
"
p262_214,"He seemed to lose his focus.
"
p262_215,"Work has started.
"
p262_216,"His death was a tragic accident.
"
p262_217,"But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
"
p262_218,"IT S the real thing, for sure.
"
p262_219,"We have not given up hope.
"
p262_220,"The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
"
p262_221,"Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
"
p262_222,"Clearly, the stakes are high.
"
p262_223,"It's a question of creating a future awareness.
"
p262_224,"The track is currently covered in snow.
"
p262_225,"Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
"
p262_226,"At the time, he was a living legend.
"
p262_227,"The Dow Jones is way up.
"
p262_228,"However, no further action was taken by police.
"
p262_229,"It's that kind of place.
"
p262_230,"But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
"
p262_231,"Half of young people had had contact with the police.
"
p262_232,"It's very safe.
"
p262_233,"A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
"
p262_234,"It is a terrible loss.
"
p262_235,"But it's a subtle process.
"
p262_236,"The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
"
p262_237,"Of further privacy, he had no need.
"
p262_238,"He was good, but not that good.
"
p262_239,"This gives a financial incentive to switch.
"
p262_240,"Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
"
p262_241,"In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
"
p262_242,"A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
"
p262_243,"Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
"
p262_244,"They may yet have the last laugh.
"
p262_245,"Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
"
p262_246,"I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
"
p262_247,"The scene is about this?
"
p262_248,"The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
"
p262_249,"It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
"
p262_250,"I was shocked.
"
p262_251,"A friendship that will endure.
"
p262_252,"I didn't need to watch it on the video.
"
p262_253,"He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
"
p262_254,"I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
"
p262_255,"That could be in place by next year.
"
p262_256,"At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
"
p262_257,"We run within the law.
"
p262_258,"That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
"
p262_259,"This is a big club.
"
p262_260,"The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
"
p262_261,"It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
"
p262_262,"I am very angry.
"
p262_263,"I saw one body.
"
p262_264,"At first I thought I was gone.
"
p262_265,"They wanted the club to make money.
"
p262_266,"We shall rely on human beings.
"
p262_267,"Immediate action must be taken.
"
p262_268,"It's very nice.
"
p262_269,"He was also married with two children.
"
p262_270,"It was an easy decision to come here.
"
p262_271,"Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
"
p262_272,"It's not even finished.
"
p262_273,"Things can change.
"
p262_274,"Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
"
p262_275,"Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
"
p262_276,"However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
"
p262_277,"His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
"
p262_278,"Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
"
p262_279,"It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
"
p262_280,"We have to break that cycle.
"
p262_281,"Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
"
p262_282,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p262_283,"I saw it at a ruck.
"
p262_284,"What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
"
p262_285,"He will address the nation this evening.
"
p262_286,"The attacker died in the crash.
"
p262_287,"It was a virus.
"
p262_288,"The mood is good.
"
p262_289,"This is a national crisis.
"
p262_290,"The death toll included five children.
"
p262_291,"Who did the recruiting?
"
p262_292,"Mr Campbell received a phone call.
"
p262_293,"It's a lovely, lovely film.
"
p262_294,"Well, he can do it.
"
p262_295,"It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
"
p262_296,"It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
"
p262_297,"And huge, indeed, it is.
"
p262_298,"The results are sometimes contentious.
"
p262_299,"It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
"
p262_300,"If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
"
p262_301,"I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
"
p262_302,"The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
"
p262_303,"Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
"
p262_304,"What has altered?
"
p262_305,"Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
"
p262_306,"One was a lawyer.
"
p262_307,"However, the groups denied the claims.
"
p262_308,"They should be swept away.
"
p262_309,"We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
"
p262_310,"It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
"
p262_311,"Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
"
p262_312,"They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
"
p262_313,"Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
"
p262_314,"The letters are going out today.
"
p262_315,"We want to play at the worlds.
"
p262_316,"Is there on his hands?
"
p262_317,"Special measures were needed.
"
p262_318,"It's about my time as a guitarist.
"
p262_319,"I never thought it would take this long.
"
p262_320,"In fact, they have the opposite effect.
"
p262_321,"We are a peaceful people.
"
p262_322,"It should be equal.
"
p262_323,"It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
"
p262_324,"The problems began a long time ago.
"
p262_325,"My body is clearly capable.
"
p262_326,"He said she was mad.
"
p262_327,"It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
"
p262_328,"Davis is very supportive, as a director.
"
p262_329,"We are in the end game.
"
p262_330,"In his absence, the council adopted the change.
"
p262_331,"The parents will have a great time, too.
"
p262_332,"I am so upset.
"
p262_333,"It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
"
p262_334,"It could have gone either way.
"
p262_335,"He was then replaced by Ross.
"
p262_336,"Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
"
p262_337,"It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
"
p262_338,"The team for the first game could be this one.
"
p262_339,"I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
"
p262_340,"The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
"
p262_341,"His views are hardly surprising.
"
p262_342,"I would miss him.
"
p262_343,"It will be very, very tight.
"
p262_344,"That is the very reason why it was so vital.
"
p262_345,"It was forced to divert.
"
p262_346,"I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
"
