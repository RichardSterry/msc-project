p227_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p227_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p227_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p227_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p227_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p227_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p227_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p227_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p227_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p227_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p227_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p227_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p227_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p227_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p227_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p227_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p227_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p227_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p227_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p227_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p227_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p227_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p227_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p227_025,"Meetings will also remain private.
"
p227_026,"Movement has to take place.
"
p227_027,"I feel I did not have enough time.
"
p227_028,"We will look into it.
"
p227_029,"This is a central issue.
"
p227_030,"Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
"
p227_031,"The Premier League has been a huge success.
"
p227_032,"There, you were just a body.
"
p227_033,"It is not for any other purpose.
"
p227_034,"President Bush is at war.
"
p227_035,"I became a widow overnight.
"
p227_036,"Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
"
p227_037,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p227_038,"She hopes to study in Britain one day.
"
p227_039,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p227_040,"Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
"
p227_041,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p227_042,"It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
"
p227_043,"I'd come back from London.
"
p227_044,"If I was a woman.
"
p227_045,"He was a home referee.
"
p227_046,"There was no safety net.
"
p227_047,"The casting of her husband was an accident.
"
p227_048,"We have to look beyond the very short term.
"
p227_049,"I expect a rapid response.
"
p227_050,"That is very hard, alone.
"
p227_051,"The motive for the shooting was not known.
"
p227_052,"In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
"
p227_053,"Four other charges were dropped.
"
p227_054,"I could not do it.
"
p227_055,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p227_056,"How are you, sir ?
"
p227_057,"So is that it, then ?
"
p227_058,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p227_059,"What do we do ?
"
p227_060,"The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
"
p227_061,"There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
"
p227_062,"They have to come up with a solution.
"
p227_063,"We will pay their bills.
"
p227_064,"Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
"
p227_065,"He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
"
p227_066,"Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
"
p227_067,"I have proved that in the past.
"
p227_068,"He had been a singer.
"
p227_069,"They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
"
p227_070,"Then followed a bout of flu.
"
p227_071,"Both sides have been hit by injury.
"
p227_072,"Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
"
p227_073,"It is a terrible place.
"
p227_074,"Even the one she loved.
"
p227_075,"After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
"
p227_076,"There may be reasons for it.
"
p227_077,"I first met him last summer.
"
p227_078,"Last week, he was taken into hospital.
"
p227_079,"Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
"
p227_080,"Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
"
p227_081,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p227_082,"We have to offer value for money.
"
p227_083,"They lived for their children.
"
p227_084,"Potions said he would drive.
"
p227_085,"The latter is due to be finished in February.
"
p227_086,"This is a complex and detailed report.
"
p227_087,"The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
"
p227_088,"We will deal with the refugees.
"
p227_089,"You might not make it.
"
p227_090,"It is open season on the Old Firm.
"
p227_091,"That is the important thing.
"
p227_092,"For once, you should believe the hype.
"
p227_093,"Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
"
p227_094,"Their attitude is all wrong.
"
p227_095,"You are like an animal.
"
p227_096,"No, the equipment is extra.
"
p227_097,"The following are the principal provisions.
"
p227_098,"It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
"
p227_099,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p227_100,"I had a fortunate war.
"
p227_101,"I did not see any reason to change the captain.
"
p227_102,"Saddam Hussein is a devil.
"
p227_103,"It was never a starter.
"
p227_104,"And the match was not too bad, either.
"
p227_105,"Such actions are rarely popular.
"
p227_106,"It is safe in our hands.
"
p227_107,"Then came the farewell to Europe.
"
p227_108,"It is much as it has been described.
"
p227_109,"You can spend money on housing.
"
p227_110,"That admission is not surprising.
"
p227_111,"Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
"
p227_112,"It has removed a bit of guilt.
"
p227_113,"However, we have to be cautious.
"
p227_114,"But we could only help a handful of people.
"
p227_116,"It is just a tax on employment.
"
p227_117,"This should begin in October.
"
p227_118,"My life has changed a lot.
"
p227_119,"We did what we had to do.
"
p227_120,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p227_121,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p227_122,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p227_123,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p227_124,"And does it ?
"
p227_125,"You've got to be vigilant.
"
p227_126,"We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
"
p227_127,"Any success would have been an improvement.
"
p227_128,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p227_129,"And I have some advice for my old friend.
"
p227_130,"He is a great addition to our team.
"
p227_131,"However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
"
p227_132,"I felt he was excellent.
"
p227_133,"They could use a boost.
"
p227_134,"It is a vicious circle.
"
p227_135,"We could easily have lost that game.
"
p227_136,"This is a limited market.
"
p227_137,"Our position is quite simple.
"
p227_138,"Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
"
p227_139,"Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
"
p227_140,"Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
"
p227_141,"He's not a Celtic man.
"
p227_142,"It opens the door to the Champions League.
"
p227_143,"So I got a blood test.
"
p227_144,"It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
"
p227_145,"These men are a part of India.
"
p227_146,"Like the others, he was arrested.
"
p227_147,"There's only one team in Ayrshire.
"
p227_148,"It was deployed in the Gulf War.
"
p227_149,"That was the difference between the sides.
"
p227_150,"Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
"
p227_151,"I was shaking on the blocks.
"
p227_152,"She had gone to the Catholic school.
"
p227_153,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p227_154,"The strong pound also took its toll.
"
p227_155,"It was a funny feeling.
"
p227_156,"I'd love to be like Peter.
"
p227_157,"Adams is surely worth a chance.
"
p227_158,"It is difficult to say.
"
p227_159,"He was in great spirits.
"
p227_160,"Seven people were later detained by police.
"
p227_161,"They want to see him.
"
p227_162,"Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
"
p227_163,"Nobody did in those days.
"
p227_164,"There is no signature on this document.
"
p227_165,"We've made a couple of albums.
"
p227_166,"What happened in that game ?
"
p227_167,"Are you going to win ?
"
p227_168,"Was it the wife ?
"
p227_169,"Why change it ?
"
p227_170,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p227_171,"The people are the hero.
"
p227_172,"One season, they might do well.
"
p227_173,"They made such decisions in London.
"
p227_174,"The second aspect was the fear of failure.
"
p227_175,"The jury is still out.
"
p227_176,"But he has a lifeline.
"
p227_177,"The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
"
p227_178,"I'm just going to hit the shot.
"
p227_179,"It makes no influence on the public.
"
p227_180,"That will apply to both sets of fans.
"
p227_181,"I think it's a good sign.
"
p227_183,"I have spoken to head office.
"
p227_184,"Well, you can have a tree.
"
p227_186,"They bought the property four years ago.
"
p227_187,"He is believed to live in Britain.
"
p227_188,"We've just had it confirmed.
"
p227_189,"A copy of the report will be sent to them.
"
p227_190,"This is the time to use it.
"
p227_191,"You know the sort of thing.
"
p227_192,"They were seriously after him.
"
p227_193,"It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
"
p227_194,"Trading conditions have not been that bad.
"
p227_195,"I'm interested in interesting work.
"
p227_196,"It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
"
p227_197,"The force is with them.
"
p227_198,"If the director is with you.
"
p227_199,"He made no order on costs.
"
p227_200,"I guess I was lucky, though.
"
p227_201,"This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
"
p227_203,"It was served by sheriff officers.
"
p227_204,"This will be our new beginning.
"
p227_205,"They have the cash and the fire power.
"
p227_206,"My heart is with the artist.
"
p227_207,"That might mean another delay.
"
p227_208,"However, it is not as simple as this.
"
p227_209,"The sanctions are about collective punishment.
"
p227_210,"This is a holy place.
"
p227_211,"Does the name matter ?
"
p227_212,"how do you get it back ?
"
p227_213,"What are you not good at ?
"
p227_214,"I think, therefore I am ?
"
p227_215,"Who was she ?
"
p227_216,"You have caught a serial killer.
"
p227_217,"It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
"
p227_218,"The move follows a review of the Singapore
"
p227_219,"They make a selective perception process.
"
p227_220,"There is no quick fix.
"
p227_222,"They have known the hard times.
"
p227_223,"That might help a bit.
"
p227_226,"I'm just a regular person.
"
p227_227,"My daughter is an adult.
"
p227_228,"He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
"
p227_229,"It's just a normal life.
"
p227_230,"He must get to know himself.
"
p227_231,"And the World Cup has not even begun.
"
p227_232,"He remains a main board director of Royal.
"
p227_233,"The fight is under way.
"
p227_235,"It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
"
p227_236,"They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
"
p227_237,"We can certainly build on this.
"
p227_238,"William Hague delighted his party.
"
p227_239,"There is a world of difference.
"
p227_240,"We played them off the pitch.
"
p227_241,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p227_242,"I can't wait to meet him.
"
p227_243,"My wife and family are the support system.
"
p227_244,"They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
"
p227_245,"It is the voice of the survivors.
"
p227_246,"She died in middle age.
"
p227_247,"It is set in Paris.
"
p227_248,"You will have seen the adverts.
"
p227_249,"It is possible to be too good.
"
p227_250,"Moreover, it must be for all sports.
"
p227_251,"They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
"
p227_252,"The irony was not lost.
"
p227_253,"Three weeks later, he resigned.
"
p227_254,"It is a court case.
"
p227_255,"It might be sad, but it's a fact.
"
p227_256,"She took them for a term.
"
p227_257,"Kingfisher can afford to wait.
"
p227_258,"Nato was not a love affair.
"
p227_259,"We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
"
p227_260,"Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
"
p227_261,"You can feel at home in China.
"
p227_262,"Our decision making was poor.
"
p227_263,"The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
"
p227_264,"The baby deserves the credit.
"
p227_265,"And they were being paid ?
"
p227_266,"Was everything done to save people ?
"
p227_267,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p227_268,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p227_269,"Is it in the right place ?
"
p227_270,"Did he trip ?
"
p227_271,"In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
"
p227_272,"I should think so, too.
"
p227_273,"No production contract is yet in sight.
"
p227_274,"The capital costs are modest.
"
p227_275,"This is no reflection on Rangers.
"
p227_276,"I told you I was ill.
"
p227_277,"I can't get a job.
"
p227_278,"That could be in place by next year.
"
p227_279,"On the contrary they stand to gain.
"
p227_280,"Blair is very positive at European Councils.
"
p227_281,"I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
"
p227_282,"It does not work that way in Scottish football.
"
p227_283,"Every one is a winner.
"
p227_284,"There's not much money in cycling.
"
p227_285,"This court has made an order which has not been observed.
"
p227_286,"Not many companies can say that these days.
"
p227_287,"They can leave at any time.
"
p227_288,"You get a lot for your money.
"
p227_289,"As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
"
p227_290,"It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
"
p227_291,"It was an easy decision to come here.
"
p227_292,"Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
"
p227_293,"He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
"
p227_294,"But the plot is not the point.
"
p227_295,"It was never a free kick.
"
p227_296,"My body is a wreck.
"
p227_297,"It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
"
p227_298,"She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
"
p227_299,"She failed in her action.
"
p227_300,"Stephen will get his first cap.
"
p227_301,"It's hard to see it.
"
p227_302,"Her appeal is to be heard this week.
"
p227_303,"We have to be very, very careful.
"
p227_304,"The partnership was set up during the summer.
"
p227_305,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p227_306,"It is an amazing response.
"
p227_307,"Size is not the issue.
"
p227_308,"He will address the nation this evening.
"
p227_309,"We have the easy part.
"
p227_310,"We are not increasing the number.
"
p227_311,"I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
"
p227_312,"They do not reflect the quality of the brand.
"
p227_313,"It could well be military.
"
p227_314,"And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.
"
p227_315,"His job was not advertised.
"
p227_316,"This is a big step up.
"
p227_317,"It goes back a long way.
"
p227_318,"The weather forecast isn't good.
"
p227_319,"We have a clean bill of health.
"
p227_320,"In that case, the children were not missing.
"
p227_321,"I have got a victim.
"
p227_322,"The judge was really nice.
"
p227_323,"If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
"
p227_324,"McNaughton was not so sure.
"
p227_326,"The dealer is on notice.
"
p227_327,"It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer.
"
p227_328,"The party lasted all night.
"
p227_329,"He would help me with the form.
"
p227_330,"There's still a bit to go.
"
p227_331,"I'm not worried about the critics.
"
p227_332,"I would do away with the dress code.
"
p227_333,"It is so easy to be negative.
"
p227_334,"What form did that take ?
"
p227_335,"Are they free ?
"
p227_336,"What are they for ?
"
p227_337,"Is there a waiting list ?
"
p227_338,"Do they think anyone else wants them ?
"
p227_339,"So what happens next ?
"
p227_340,"The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
"
p227_341,"I am not obsessed with sex.
"
p227_342,"Have a look at this lot.
"
p227_343,"That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
"
p227_344,"Public opinion was split on the proposal.
"
p227_345,"The king is delighted by the honour.
"
p227_347,"I've got a sense of humour, too.
"
p227_348,"In the old days, it was easy.
"
p227_349,"I came into this world with nothing.
"
p227_350,"This is a trend which will be encouraged.
"
p227_351,"There will have to be a full inquiry.
"
p227_352,"There was no time scale.
"
p227_353,"In his absence, the council adopted the change.
"
p227_354,"Whether this return was too soon.
"
p227_355,"The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
"
p227_356,"They were the acts of men.
"
p227_357,"Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
"
p227_358,"Of course, we want to go home.
"
p227_359,"I am very interested in the subject.
"
p227_360,"He is not very big, either.
"
p227_361,"A report is expected next month.
"
p227_363,"We are encouraged by the news.
"
p227_364,"Had this been common practice ?
"
p227_365,"What do they want us to do ?
"
p227_366,"Is it worth it ?
"
p227_367,"Does it matter ?
"
p227_368,"A crucial moment has arrived.
"
p227_369,"Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
"
p227_370,"We need to be prepared.
"
