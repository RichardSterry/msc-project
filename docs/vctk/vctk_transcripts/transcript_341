p341_001,Please call Stella.
p341_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p341_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p341_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p341_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p341_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p341_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p341_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p341_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p341_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p341_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p341_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p341_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
p341_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p341_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p341_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p341_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p341_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p341_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p341_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p341_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p341_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p341_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p341_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p341_025,This guy is never going to give up.
p341_026,That's interesting to me.
p341_027,I managed to take her completely by surprise.
p341_028,"It is only one night, after all."
p341_029,The injuries are not too serious.
p341_030,Gilbert was not amused.
p341_031,"I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice."
p341_032,It has moved on in the last week.
p341_033,Everything was up for grabs.
p341_034,It's easy to see why.
p341_035,I am proud of moments like that.
p341_036,That was no surprise to me.
p341_037,This has been blown out of all proportion.
p341_038,There is no escape.
p341_039,It's wonderful to have won.
p341_040,Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p341_041,"He was arrested, but later released without charge."
p341_042,I fell into it by accident.
p341_043,Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p341_044,This is a big advantage.
p341_045,Her daughter is getting married.
p341_046,Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
p341_047,"If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment."
p341_048,All the lads are totally focused on that.
p341_049,Today is not about contracts.
p341_050,That says something for his strength of character.
p341_051,We are going for it.
p341_052,"You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals."
p341_053,It's to do with play.
p341_054,"However, the appeal judges rejected the argument."
p341_055,I've just got to do this.
p341_056,"It's not, of course, a concert hall."
p341_057,So the process was refined.
p341_058,Labour accused the Tory leader of panicking.
p341_059,"I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me."
p341_060,I think it is a sensible change.
p341_061,Sex is fun?
p341_062,"They were not doing it too well, either."
p341_063,"He added, It's not a racial problem."
p341_064,This is the crossroads.
p341_065,He had played well in that central role.
p341_066,He is pretty upset.
p341_067,And who would argue with that?
p341_068,Where is the human rights?
p341_069,We must put a marker down.
p341_070,The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p341_071,"Now, just two games into the season, he has gone."
p341_072,It is time to give her a rest.
p341_073,They had had time for little else.
p341_074,The feeling is awesome.
p341_075,We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p341_076,But there was a shift.
p341_077,The settlement could run to millions.
p341_078,It does not stop at the border.

p341_080,He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p341_081,Robert is a special talent.
p341_082,"John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint."
p341_083,"In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key."
p341_084,They are going to carry it through.
p341_085,"She added, It is a huge problem."
p341_086,You can't keep them separate.
p341_087,The composer therefore believes he can do it.
p341_088,I still feel like a wee boy.
p341_089,He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p341_090,The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p341_091,It had a gigantic effect.
p341_092,Israel has done very little until now.
p341_093,Debate was impassioned and furious.
p341_094,We are losing this war.
p341_095,It's a difficult one to play.
p341_096,The death rates are still as high.
p341_097,We are seeing a Government in a hurry.
p341_098,It is a great honour and a privilege.
p341_099,We certainly will need to watch him.
p341_100,I don't think it could be clearer.
p341_101,That meant the search was unlawful.
p341_102,He put some colour into Scottish history.
p341_103,People buy everything with cash.
p341_104,We are trying to establish a date.
p341_105,He is a law unto himself.

p341_107,There was great support all round the route.
p341_108,I was a bit nervous.
p341_109,It was a bit of a struggle today.
p341_110,It was love of Helen and the children.
p341_111,"If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?"
p341_112,I love this tournament.
p341_113,This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p341_114,He had a heart problem.
p341_115,The breakdown was much later in her life.
p341_116,"I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role."
p341_117,Both managements are very supportive.
p341_118,Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p341_119,"He's delighted, too, with the new premises."
p341_120,The choice is strictly personal.
p341_121,We are going to go about our lives.
p341_122,He had other things on his mind.
p341_123,The lady is right.
p341_124,I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p341_125,"Don Hutchison, too, is a threat."
p341_126,The next few months will tell.
p341_127,I'm so proud of my team.
p341_128,It is crucial for both teams.
p341_129,"It ended as it began, in confusion."
p341_130,I am now just a bit uneasy.
p341_131,You can see their point.
p341_132,"Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry."
p341_133,There was no hint of bravado.
p341_134,"However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks."
p341_135,Yet he chose to do something different.
p341_136,"He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy."
p341_137,"At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough."
p341_138,There were no casualties.
p341_139,The case will now go to appeal.
p341_140,They really did a great job.
p341_141,"A teacher is, really, about unity."
p341_142,They are still going to be impulsive.
p341_143,I love you so very much.
p341_144,He is a very nice man.
p341_145,The road was closed for several hours.
p341_146,Their condition was described as stable.
p341_147,There's a good chance of seeing something.

p341_153,My aim is a top six finish.
p341_154,He came in an army uniform.
p341_155,We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p341_156,It was to no avail.
p341_157,Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p341_158,But my heart is in athletics.
p341_159,That is in the very nature of farming.
p341_160,You shouldn't have a stoppage in November.
p341_161,These matters are now behind us.
p341_162,I'm working on that.
p341_163,I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p341_164,It was then into overtime.
p341_165,Most of the public are behind me.
p341_166,The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p341_167,It really is a gift to the world.
p341_168,Look at his last couple of records.

p341_175,Of course he is.
p341_176,This is a very positive step forward.

p341_179,And does it?

p341_181,That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p341_182,Nobody ever knew it had happened.
p341_183,She is a very lucky lady.

p341_187,His signature is his handwriting.
p341_188,He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p341_189,I've already done that.
p341_190,We are on the path of change.
p341_191,You can feel at home in China.
p341_192,Who is he?
p341_193,It has to be a long-term commitment.
p341_194,No such remedy has ever been pursued.
p341_195,Felt good about it.
p341_196,It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p341_197,The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p341_198,Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p341_199,What's the big idea?
p341_200,"One season, they might do well."
p341_201,"It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy."
p341_202,"NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers."
p341_203,Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p341_204,It's up to their parents to choose.
p341_205,I feel privileged to be here.
p341_206,"If they don't, they might well decide not to play."
p341_207,She told me to apply for the crest.
p341_208,Too much has already been said.
p341_209,"John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news."
p341_210,He explained to his audience.
p341_211,I think the Government should pay for that.
p341_212,I asked why he had come.
p341_213,He was a soldier.
p341_214,The budget was too low for that.
p341_215,All inquiries should be made to the police.
p341_216,It didn't get any better.
p341_217,I'm a bit annoyed.
p341_218,He doesn't like the Labour Party.
p341_219,I am totally devoted to this job.
p341_220,I just could not cope.
p341_221,He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p341_222,It is all one-sided.
p341_223,I've been thinking about it for a year.
p341_224,Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p341_225,Here are some possible solutions.
p341_226,That's the day job.
p341_227,Glasgow is going to be open for business.
p341_228,IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
p341_229,I'm not saying he is finished.
p341_230,That probably wouldn't happen at Liverpool.
p341_231,He is well respected by his colleagues.
p341_232,"It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point."
p341_233,"Usually, you should leave it alone in the box."
p341_234,I would have dropped out otherwise.
p341_236,"Nato would ensure they could return home, he said."
p341_237,Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p341_238,We believe we have a strong case.
p341_239,I lost it at the final whistle.
p341_240,Bill is a mentor.
p341_241,They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p341_242,I think he has undergone a sea change.
p341_243,One must hope not!
p341_244,It was a big day.
p341_245,What makes a house a home?
p341_246,"I think however, he was having a fit!"
p341_247,I live on the streets of Glasgow.
p341_248,I will not be pressured.
p341_249,It doesn't make sense.
p341_250,I'll go back home and see my family.
p341_251,He admitted the asylum system was not working.
p341_252,Have we not had the rainy season already?
p341_253,I have heard the stories from Scotland.
p341_254,"Sub Not Used, McKay."
p341_255,Do not listen to them.
p341_256,"Mind you, who wouldn't?"
p341_257,"That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?"
p341_258,He loves the big occasions.
p341_259,Our system is archaic.
p341_260,It was a tactical change.
p341_261,"That's what it's all about, isn't it?"
p341_262,When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p341_263,"This time, there were no such rewards."
p341_264,He said Mr Holland was a disgrace.
p341_265,"I gave him a way out, and he took it."
p341_266,"Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant."
p341_267,She became very good at it.
p341_268,We don't have the credible evidence.
p341_269,It's one up to the Scots.
p341_270,I'm just doing artwork.
p341_271,And we still have to pay his salary.
p341_272,"Also, he was flawed."
p341_273,Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p341_274,So there's a double whammy.
p341_275,I didn't have a trio.
p341_276,Their three other children had died as infants.
p341_277,That is a mark of what you are.
p341_278,His wife Margaret was not in court.
p341_279,"Is it the players, or is it the coaches?"
p341_280,I hope my successor will do the same.
p341_281,The manager knew me very well.
p341_282,I have been totally taken aback by this.
p341_283,Are you in this movie?
p341_284,We've got a full house tonight.
p341_285,"If they don't, they won't get what they want."
p341_286,The fans will support us.
p341_287,Make sure you see it.
p341_288,"It has, however, been a long time coming."
p341_289,We are aware of the two incidents.
p341_290,We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p341_291,It was just one of those things.
p341_292,The whole team was rubbish.
p341_293,Now we need to keep our heads up.
p341_294,You've got it coming Kabul.
p341_295,They must act now to tighten the rules.
p341_296,They too refused to come out and talk.
p341_297,"But, mainly, it is up to ourselves."
p341_298,"It's the curse of our time, irony."
p341_299,That was enough for the committee.
p341_300,It's a source of deep concern.
p341_301,"Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep."
p341_302,"But it was for charity, just a bit of fun."
p341_303,"Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder."
p341_304,It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
p341_305,"However, there are also many areas of agreement."
p341_306,Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p341_307,The Dow Jones is way up.
p341_308,We have to adapt to this level.
p341_309,They were the better side on the day.
p341_310,What are you going to do exactly?
p341_311,"We have lost the round, but not the fight."
p341_312,There is nothing like a fresh start.
p341_313,Calderwood would agree with that.
p341_314,No-one thought about this.
p341_315,We're all in a state of shock.
p341_316,I thought he was part of the camera.
p341_317,You will never forget the clutching horror.
p341_318,Farmers have been an endangered species.
p341_319,This is very bad news.
p341_320,He was released in March this year.
p341_321,"No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task."
p341_322,I stayed away from the defence.
p341_323,We do need to get the message across.
p341_324,"Instead, she just went away."
p341_325,That did not go down well.
p341_326,The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p341_327,It was chaotic and frightening.
p341_328,It is a question of balance.
p341_329,Soon the whole country will be level.
p341_330,"And huge, indeed, it is."
p341_331,Tax is a matter for national governments.
p341_332,I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p341_333,Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p341_334,"For his opposite number, this was just triumph."
p341_335,He said he needed no more evidence.
p341_336,People might not actually want the job.
p341_337,It is the logical extension of audio description.
p341_338,It broke up my marriage.
p341_339,They told us about it the next day.
p341_340,"Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved."
p341_341,If there is default.
p341_342,We are very nearly there.
p341_343,He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p341_344,We have to go for it.
p341_345,I'm surprised that it has taken this approach.
p341_346,Barry will be able to handle this.
p341_347,This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p341_348,The urgency is real.
p341_349,I've already got them in.
p341_350,He takes time out for everyone.
p341_351,"The science is well known, the solution is simple."
p341_352,They are just bewildered and very concerned.
p341_353,I can't stop people thinking.
p341_354,The workers said they were treated like animals.
p341_355,I have not been so angry for years.
p341_356,She had every right to read the warrant.
p341_357,This is normal for him now.
p341_358,Nothing was going to go right.
p341_359,There is too much at stake for that.
p341_360,Nobody ever gets to see them.
p341_361,That's an old idea.
p341_362,Scotland is losing business.
p341_363,The place became a war zone.
p341_364,What's happening to her?
p341_365,It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p341_366,"Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result."
p341_367,The surprise is its product is so poor.
p341_368,I don't have a new house.
p341_369,It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
p341_370,Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p341_371,You are a liar.
p341_372,Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
p341_373,He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p341_374,See it while you can.
p341_375,Folk music is in her blood.
p341_376,And we all understand that.
p341_377,One policeman was killed.
p341_378,And it's not funny.
p341_379,I didn't do too badly myself.
p341_380,We cannot lose it.
p341_381,They have learned from that.
p341_382,We have been working together for some years.
p341_383,Chris Paterson is a class act.
p341_384,We only lost the third goal.
p341_385,And that's the question for the Chamber.
p341_386,That gave us some confidence.
p341_387,No-one has yet been charged.
p341_388,Such people do not exist.
p341_389,Is this new report the answer?
p341_390,Then came the second round.
p341_391,It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p341_392,There was someone on the floor.
p341_393,Story time is over - it's a war.
p341_394,"Maybe, who knows?"
p341_395,"However, this idea is never developed."
p341_396,But it is all by design.
p341_397,It was a sell-out.
p341_398,We've still got a say in this.
p341_399,Things are going very well.
p341_400,"She can't say where she was, what she did."
p341_401,I'll take what comes along.
p341_402,Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p341_403,She will just have wanted her baby.
p341_404,Golf has lost a great character.
p341_405,You have to have some hope and faith.
p341_406,They hold on for many years.
p341_407,"However, the report was incorrect."
p341_408,Women reported more depression than men.
p341_409,He needs to be.
p341_410,"The euro is your money, it is our money."
