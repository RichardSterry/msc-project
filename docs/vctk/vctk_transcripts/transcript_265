p265_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p265_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p265_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p265_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p265_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p265_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p265_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p265_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p265_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p265_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p265_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p265_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p265_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p265_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p265_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p265_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p265_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p265_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p265_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p265_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p265_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p265_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p265_025,"Is this accurate?
"
p265_026,"However, the following year the cancer returned.
"
p265_027,"They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
"
p265_028,"This is the window.
"
p265_029,"We speak about the performance.
"
p265_030,"It's a fact.
"
p265_031,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p265_032,"It has failed.
"
p265_033,"It was clear.
"
p265_034,"A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
"
p265_035,"Indeed, he does.
"
p265_036,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p265_037,"Dancing was her life.
"
p265_038,"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
"
p265_039,"It's the only thing.
"
p265_040,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p265_041,"A neighbour said.
"
p265_042,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p265_043,"She looked so young.
"
p265_044,"This is a club on the rise.
"
p265_045,"I guess I was lucky, though.
"
p265_046,"There was no safety net.
"
p265_047,"It is unique.
"
p265_048,"I expect a rapid response.
"
p265_049,"TODAY it begins.
"
p265_050,"Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
"
p265_051,"The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
"
p265_052,"It's that kind of place.
"
p265_053,"They are real.
"
p265_054,"I've spent a lot of time on buses.
"
p265_055,"Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
"
p265_056,"I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
"
p265_057,"Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
"
p265_058,"He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
"
p265_059,"Robin Williams is very subdued.
"
p265_060,"The tournament has now been cancelled.
"
p265_061,"A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
"
p265_063,"IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
"
p265_064,"Neither it is.
"
p265_065,"For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
"
p265_066,"Is there a new way forward?
"
p265_067,"I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
"
p265_068,"The results are tragic.
"
p265_069,"Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
"
p265_070,"It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
"
p265_071,"What has changed?
"
p265_072,"He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
"
p265_073,"He seems to be pleased with the picture.
"
p265_074,"A play is a set of actions.
"
p265_075,"Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
"
p265_076,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p265_077,"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
"
p265_078,"They lived for their children.
"
p265_079,"It will be tight.
"
p265_080,"The city council is a major property owner in the area.
"
p265_081,"Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
"
p265_082,"It is a lifeline.
"
p265_083,"Maloney is an engaging talent.
"
p265_084,"I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
"
p265_085,"This one did.
"
p265_086,"They are now divorced.
"
p265_087,"I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
"
p265_088,"I saw the whole thing.
"
p265_089,"It was mayhem.
"
p265_090,"Journalists should make him.
"
p265_091,"It is a love affair.
"
p265_092,"However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
"
p265_093,"May not have been at fault?
"
p265_094,"They tried to deny it.
"
p265_095,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p265_096,"Oil embargo endorsed.
"
p265_097,"He takes the job.
"
p265_098,"She reflects a bit.
"
p265_099,"Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
"
p265_100,"The cause of the fire is not yet known.
"
p265_101,"I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
"
p265_102,"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
"
p265_103,"He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
"
p265_104,"It's a shame.
"
p265_105,"It was the eighties.
"
p265_106,"I did not see any reason to change the captain.
"
p265_107,"You had better believe it.
"
p265_108,"It is rubbish.
"
p265_109,"Who would be a referee?
"
p265_110,"That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
"
p265_111,"There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
"
p265_112,"That's all right then.
"
p265_113,"I'm so angry.
"
p265_114,"Holland won by five wickets.
"
p265_115,"The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
"
p265_116,"Twaddle is a case in point.
"
p265_117,"The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
"
p265_118,"It plans to return to this field.
"
p265_119,"They took a risk.
"
p265_120,"We work well together.
"
p265_121,"What will happen then?
"
p265_122,"The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
"
p265_123,"Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
"
p265_124,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p265_125,"Is that it?
"
p265_126,"It is a time bomb.
"
p265_127,"I was dead.
"
p265_128,"I don't know the full story.
"
p265_129,"It seems so long since I did the exams.
"
p265_130,"And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
"
p265_131,"She died at her home.
"
p265_132,"He realises his mistake.
"
p265_133,"They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
"
p265_134,"The idea is simple.
"
p265_135,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p265_136,"He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
"
p265_137,"Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
"
p265_138,"You know the type.
"
p265_139,"I was stunned.
"
p265_140,"The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
"
p265_141,"The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
"
p265_142,"They have not been named.
"
p265_143,"We are now up against it.
"
p265_144,"We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
"
p265_145,"He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
"
p265_146,"Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
"
p265_147,"Well, he should know.
"
p265_148,"I will tell you.
"
p265_149,"I've put my own money into this project.
"
p265_150,"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
"
p265_151,"She is an expert on medical ethics.
"
p265_152,"It has to be now.
"
p265_153,"Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
"
p265_154,"It is not like us.
"
p265_155,"Seven people were later detained by police.
"
p265_156,"By then, however, both men were already in the US.
"
p265_157,"They will do their own thing.
"
p265_158,"You had to go and see him.
"
p265_159,"It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
"
p265_160,"They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
"
p265_161,"Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
"
p265_162,"Blair's response was weak.
"
p265_163,"But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
"
p265_164,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p265_165,"It is not either national standards or local control.
"
p265_166,"He deserved the win.
"
p265_167,"I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
"
p265_168,"Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
"
p265_169,"They know no other way.
"
p265_170,"I've been there.
"
p265_171,"It's an idea.
"
p265_172,"And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
"
p265_173,"Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
"
p265_174,"It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
"
p265_175,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p265_176,"I saw military vehicles in the distance.
"
p265_177,"Does this matter?
"
p265_178,"One was a lawyer.
"
p265_179,"I put the drawing down.
"
p265_180,"Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
"
p265_181,"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
"
p265_182,"But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
"
p265_183,"It is a farce.
"
p265_184,"Peace was won.
"
p265_185,"It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
"
p265_186,"It was very frightened and dirty.
"
p265_187,"Is that success?
"
p265_188,"The service from the other players was super.
"
p265_189,"On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
"
p265_190,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p265_191,"The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
"
p265_192,"The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
"
p265_193,"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
"
p265_194,"It's all about money, money, money.
"
p265_195,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p265_196,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p265_197,"I don't want to use it.
"
p265_198,"This gives a financial incentive to switch.
"
p265_199,"We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
"
p265_200,"I had decided to quit the show.
"
p265_201,"People must remain vigilant.
"
p265_202,"So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
"
p265_203,"He seemed to lose his focus.
"
p265_204,"I might come back.
"
p265_205,"The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
"
p265_206,"He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
"
p265_207,"Because they didn't want to know.
"
p265_208,"That has been the easy part.
"
p265_209,"But she was.
"
p265_210,"This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
"
p265_211,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p265_212,"I'd never seen a play about me.
"
p265_213,"It's not before time.
"
p265_214,"The report is due out next month.
"
p265_215,"I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
"
p265_216,"Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
"
p265_217,"At the time, he was a living legend.
"
p265_218,"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
"
p265_219,"Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
"
p265_220,"We were awful.
"
p265_221,"We are so proud.
"
p265_222,"The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
"
p265_223,"I can leave at the end of the day.
"
p265_224,"Until they came to do it.
"
p265_225,"Half of young people had had contact with the police.
"
p265_226,"Wealth is relative.
"
p265_227,"Well, they were the unlucky ones.
"
p265_228,"You should be.
"
p265_229,"It's quite nice.
"
p265_230,"On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
"
p265_231,"It would still have been a good film, but very different.
"
p265_232,"I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
"
p265_233,"He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
"
p265_234,"In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
"
p265_235,"Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
"
p265_236,"I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
"
p265_237,"In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
"
p265_238,"We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
"
p265_239,"In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
"
p265_240,"Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
"
p265_241,"It was a hit.
"
p265_242,"There's the mix.
"
p265_243,"The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
"
p265_244,"I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
"
p265_245,"That could be in place by next year.
"
p265_246,"For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
"
p265_247,"There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
"
p265_248,"However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
"
p265_249,"Chelsea was a great club.
"
p265_250,"We have to expand.
"
p265_251,"It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
"
p265_252,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p265_253,"Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
"
p265_254,"However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
"
p265_255,"This court has made an order which has not been observed.
"
p265_256,"Souter will be back.
"
p265_257,"I am just trying to do my job.
"
p265_258,"Blood samples were taken.
"
p265_259,"They want to shut the Scottish Office.
"
p265_260,"This is a question of Islam.
"
p265_262,"Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
"
p265_263,"It's a way of life.
"
p265_264,"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
"
p265_265,"She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
"
p265_266,"They seem to get away with it.
"
p265_267,"The record companies have gone through the floor.
"
p265_268,"In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
"
p265_269,"In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
"
p265_270,"Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
"
p265_271,"We have to break that cycle.
"
p265_272,"He looked very sharp.
"
p265_273,"Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
"
p265_274,"This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
"
p265_275,"You've got to have both sides.
"
p265_276,"What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
"
p265_277,"Dialogue is the key.
"
p265_278,"It was a virus.
"
p265_279,"Yet, it worked.
"
p265_280,"The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
"
p265_281,"This is a national crisis.
"
p265_282,"Who did the recruiting?
"
p265_283,"So I did.
"
p265_284,"We are not going to forget.
"
p265_285,"What has altered?
"
p265_286,"The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
"
p265_287,"There is no openness.
"
p265_288,"I can live with it.
"
p265_289,"In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
"
p265_290,"The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
"
p265_291,"They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
"
p265_292,"Last night was a key episode.
"
p265_293,"It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
"
p265_294,"You are the glory.
"
p265_295,"The minister is the engineer.
"
p265_296,"The letters are going out today.
"
p265_297,"Surely, if anything, it would be the other way around.
"
p265_298,"Is there on his hands?
"
p265_299,"We are a peaceful people.
"
p265_300,"Kids are terrible.
"
p265_301,"Horses are drawn by ballot.
"
p265_302,"My body is clearly capable.
"
p265_303,"Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
"
p265_304,"They had a confession.
"
p265_305,"It will work.
"
p265_306,"I came into this world with nothing.
"
p265_307,"It's too horrible to think.
"
p265_308,"Either team will be hard.
"
p265_309,"But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
"
p265_310,"My view has now completely changed.
"
p265_311,"The party is up for it.
"
p265_312,"Is that an issue?
"
p265_313,"Finally, he paid for the movie.
"
p265_314,"In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
"
p265_315,"The same things will happen with GM foods.
"
p265_316,"Who will do it?
"
p265_317,"That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
"
p265_318,"Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
"
p265_319,"Two people were interviewed.
"
p265_320,"I'm very lucky.
"
p265_321,"It's very good.
"
p265_322,"This is a friendly match?
"
p265_323,"I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
"
p265_324,"They should take their mobile phones.
"
p265_325,"From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
"
p265_326,"The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
"
p265_327,"Tell us about it.
"
p265_328,"She said they would appeal.
"
p265_329,"But we finished the show.
"
p265_330,"Both of those promises have already been honoured.
"
p265_331,"There is no excuse.
"
p265_332,"The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
"
p265_333,"The pair are very much in love.
"
p265_334,"As, indeed, they would be.
"
p265_335,"It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
"
p265_336,"Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
"
p265_337,"The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
"
p265_338,"That would help.
"
p265_339,"Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
"
p265_340,"On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
"
p265_341,"It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
"
p265_342,"There was a substantial explosion.
"
p265_343,"It's not pretty, but it's effective.
"
p265_344,"He could face a jail sentence.
"
p265_345,"We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
"
p265_346,"It's been hard.
"
p265_347,"The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
"
p265_348,"A review is under way.
"
p265_349,"Safety was also an issue.
"
p265_350,"So there, we won.
"
p265_351,"He was the architect.
"
p265_352,"I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
"
