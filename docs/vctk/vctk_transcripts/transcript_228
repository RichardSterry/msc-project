p228_001,"Please call Stella.
"
p228_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
"
p228_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
"
p228_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
"
p228_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
"
p228_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
"
p228_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
"
p228_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
"
p228_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
"
p228_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it.
"
p228_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
"
p228_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
"
p228_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
"
p228_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
"
p228_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
"
p228_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
"
p228_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
"
p228_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
"
p228_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
"
p228_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
"
p228_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
"
p228_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
"
p228_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p228_025,"It's nice to hear.
"
p228_026,"So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
"
p228_027,"Because we do not need it.
"
p228_028,"There's a story, too.
"
p228_029,"I feel I did not have enough time.
"
p228_030,"Life was like a timetable.
"
p228_031,"He took me on a tour of the wards.
"
p228_032,"We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
"
p228_033,"However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
"
p228_034,"In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
"
p228_035,"It was clear.
"
p228_036,"The problem is the pitch.
"
p228_037,"Indeed, he does.
"
p228_038,"President Bush is at war.
"
p228_039,"She is believed to be in South Africa.
"
p228_040,"My whole life has changed.
"
p228_041,"On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
"
p228_042,"No meaningful response was issued.
"
p228_043,"It is urgent.
"
p228_044,"Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
"
p228_045,"Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
"
p228_046,"We need to chat.
"
p228_047,"We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
"
p228_048,"The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures.
"
p228_049,"But it might have done.
"
p228_050,"Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
"
p228_051,"Mary Archer is almost too clever.
"
p228_052,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p228_053,"Here's a clue.
"
p228_054,"It had been in place since last July.
"
p228_055,"However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
"
p228_056,"That's the day job.
"
p228_057,"For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
"
p228_058,"That's the truth.
"
p228_059,"That is very hard, alone.
"
p228_060,"He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
"
p228_061,"Four other charges were dropped.
"
p228_062,"They're appalled by that.
"
p228_063,"There was a battle there.
"
p228_064,"Scotland had great assets.
"
p228_065,"It's that kind of place.
"
p228_066,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p228_067,"An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
"
p228_068,"And if he hadn't become a musician ?
"
p228_069,"He is a young man with a new deal.
"
p228_070,"Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
"
p228_071,"The script was funny.
"
p228_072,"Try to save us.
"
p228_073,"Sounds like The Sixth Sense ?
"
p228_074,"Painful, but only because it's true.
"
p228_075,"They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
"
p228_076,"It's all I can do.
"
p228_077,"They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
"
p228_078,"Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
"
p228_079,"I had my suspicions.
"
p228_081,"People must remain vigilant.
"
p228_082,"Today she has been released.
"
p228_083,"That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
"
p228_084,"He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
"
p228_085,"But she might be.
"
p228_086,"Nothing is yet confirmed.
"
p228_087,"Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
"
p228_088,"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
"
p228_089,"Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
"
p228_090,"Now the system is right behind us.
"
p228_091,"Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
"
p228_092,"Today I couldn't run on it.
"
p228_093,"However, it did not end that way.
"
p228_094,"This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
"
p228_095,"Safety was also an issue.
"
p228_096,"It is an old family habit.
"
p228_097,"I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
"
p228_098,"The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
"
p228_099,"It is annoying.
"
p228_100,"We could not get any possession.
"
p228_101,"I love the Dome.
"
p228_102,"We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
"
p228_103,"I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
"
p228_104,"He is hungry for success and I am the same.
"
p228_105,"Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
"
p228_106,"Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
"
p228_107,"It is a good day for the coalition.
"
p228_108,"A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
"
p228_109,"However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
"
p228_110,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p228_111,"Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
"
p228_112,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p228_113,"For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
"
p228_114,"They will want to perform well.
"
p228_115,"The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
"
p228_116,"However, they will only be found in the wild.
"
p228_117,"It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
"
p228_118,"Further protests are likely.
"
p228_119,"It's in his blood.
"
p228_120,"I don't want to use the term.
"
p228_121,"The picture is the same across Scotland.
"
p228_122,"Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
"
p228_123,"It is so sad.
"
p228_124,"It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
"
p228_125,"Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
"
p228_126,"Who would be a referee ?
"
p228_127,"They've got to account for it.
"
p228_128,"It is a delight on every level.
"
p228_129,"An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
"
p228_130,"Here, again, they were denied a voice.
"
p228_131,"I felt very strongly that England should have it.
"
p228_132,"It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
"
p228_133,"This plan is an agenda for action.
"
p228_134,"Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
"
p228_135,"Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
"
p228_136,"Offered the gold medal, he declined.
"
p228_137,"Who will attend ?
"
p228_138,"We had a reunion last week.
"
p228_139,"Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
"
p228_140,"We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
"
p228_141,"I was the last man to touch the ball.
"
p228_142,"He was in a great deal of pain.
"
p228_143,"Nobody in the world can get away from him.
"
p228_144,"She hopes to study in Britain one day.
"
p228_145,"Wallace was a prisoner of war.
"
p228_146,"I think he's the favourite, no question.
"
p228_147,"Who would be right ?
"
p228_148,"It is difficult for Ali.
"
p228_149,"Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
"
p228_150,"Had she enjoyed the experience ?
"
p228_151,"That should do it.
"
p228_152,"That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
"
p228_153,"It is not just about pay.
"
p228_154,"I am just trying to do my job.
"
p228_155,"It opens the door to the Champions League.
"
p228_156,"The home side didn't stand a chance.
"
p228_157,"The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
"
p228_158,"The weather forecast isn't good.
"
p228_159,"The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
"
p228_160,"There's a sense of excess in the novel.
"
p228_161,"We also enjoyed a lot of support.
"
p228_162,"It was by the numbers.
"
p228_163,"I was in daily contact.
"
p228_164,"The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
"
p228_165,"Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
"
p228_166,"It was so new, so exciting.
"
p228_167,"But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
"
p228_168,"I've put my own money into this project.
"
p228_169,"Eight months later, he was dead.
"
p228_170,"They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
"
p228_171,"We have to move forward.
"
p228_172,"By then, however, both men were already in the US.
"
p228_173,"We have to sort it out ourselves.
"
p228_174,"The post will be unpaid.
"
p228_175,"As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
"
p228_176,"And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
"
p228_177,"We've made a couple of albums.
"
p228_178,"They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
"
p228_179,"Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
"
p228_180,"One season, they might do well.
"
p228_181,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p228_182,"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
"
p228_183,"The hotel was now for sale.
"
p228_184,"I drove the ball well.
"
p228_185,"I took the gun.
"
p228_186,"We knew nothing about it.
"
p228_187,"They will run a mile.
"
p228_188,"It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
"
p228_189,"Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
"
p228_190,"Miller was every bit as happy.
"
p228_191,"I put the drawing down.
"
p228_192,"The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
"
p228_193,"It was an odd affair, in many respects.
"
p228_194,"Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
"
p228_195,"We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
"
p228_196,"We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
"
p228_197,"The procedure is the same in all cases.
"
p228_198,"But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
"
p228_199,"The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
"
p228_200,"I wanted to put myself on the line.
"
p228_202,"It's the same old story.
"
p228_203,"It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
"
p228_204,"Is that success ?
"
p228_205,"I have a cold.
"
p228_206,"They are in the euro.
"
p228_207,"Ferguson should take note.
"
p228_208,"I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
"
p228_209,"Who will pay for this ?
"
p228_210,"They've got three-quarters of the way.
"
p228_211,"He had suffered a heart attack.
"
p228_212,"A deadline is still essential.
"
p228_213,"Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man.
"
p228_214,"We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
"
p228_215,"After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
"
p228_216,"That will be vital.
"
p228_217,"Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
"
p228_218,"That is an important part of our role.
"
p228_219,"She should not be blamed.
"
p228_220,"I had decided to quit the show.
"
p228_221,"His third goal was superb.
"
p228_222,"It's been a good year.
"
p228_223,"The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
"
p228_224,"He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
"
p228_225,"Women were mostly notable by their absence.
"
p228_226,"The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
"
p228_227,"Clearly, the stakes are high.
"
p228_228,"It is a gamble.
"
p228_229,"It's so special.
"
p228_230,"You take a risk.
"
p228_231,"He is severe.
"
p228_232,"We just had a go.
"
p228_233,"We are in the hat.
"
p228_234,"We were a load of rubbish.
"
p228_235,"Well, they were the unlucky ones.
"
p228_236,"On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
"
p228_237,"The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
"
p228_238,"I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
"
p228_239,"He claimed the government had lost the plot.
"
p228_240,"She was well balanced.
"
p228_241,"It's only fair.
"
p228_242,"He says that he is no different from any other man.
"
p228_243,"You can feel at home in China.
"
p228_244,"In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
"
p228_245,"It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
"
p228_246,"Washington is consumed by the crisis.
"
p228_247,"He's a lovely young man.
"
p228_248,"It was a hit.
"
p228_249,"He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
"
p228_250,"I can't get a job.
"
p228_251,"He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
"
p228_252,"It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
"
p228_253,"That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
"
p228_254,"Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
"
p228_255,"That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
"
p228_256,"One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
"
p228_257,"Is that a serious question ?
"
p228_258,"They are real.
"
p228_259,"They must play for each other.
"
p228_260,"I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
"
p228_261,"His contract was then not renewed.
"
p228_262,"He thought he had a month to cross the street.
"
p228_263,"Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
"
p228_264,"That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
"
p228_265,"Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
"
p228_266,"Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
"
p228_267,"It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
"
p228_268,"I was rubbish.
"
p228_269,"He's been here on numerous occasions.
"
p228_270,"Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
"
p228_271,"It's a way of life.
"
p228_272,"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
"
p228_274,"It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
"
p228_275,"They were too hard.
"
p228_276,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p228_277,"Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
"
p228_278,"All options are open.
"
p228_279,"He will address the nation this evening.
"
p228_280,"We want to see the maximum of change.
"
p228_281,"Mr Campbell received a phone call.
"
p228_282,"He was obviously very genuine.
"
p228_283,"She said she could not believe that they had run away.
"
p228_284,"It changed my life.
"
p228_285,"The songs are just so good.
"
p228_286,"I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
"
p228_287,"Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
"
p228_288,"It became a book by itself.
"
p228_289,"The home was now under new management.
"
p228_290,"Graeme was prepared.
"
p228_291,"Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
"
p228_292,"He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
"
p228_293,"Our task is to complete the picture.
"
p228_294,"They are wrong.
"
p228_295,"It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
"
p228_296,"They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
"
p228_297,"You are the glory.
"
p228_298,"It's certainly different.
"
p228_299,"A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
"
p228_300,"We want to play at the worlds.
"
p228_301,"We have waited a long time for this.
"
p228_302,"Is there on his hands ?
"
p228_303,"This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
"
p228_304,"It's not even finished.
"
p228_305,"We are a peaceful people.
"
p228_306,"Kids are terrible.
"
p228_307,"The problems began a long time ago.
"
p228_308,"This film will be totally awesome.
"
p228_309,"He said she was mad.
"
p228_310,"There was some merit in that.
"
p228_311,"I am very happy to be here.
"
p228_312,"We do the same.
"
p228_313,"In his absence, the council adopted the change.
"
p228_315,"It's not long enough.
"
p228_316,"Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
"
p228_317,"It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
"
p228_318,"He was then replaced by Ross.
"
p228_319,"Is that an issue ?
"
p228_320,"My first concern is for the safety of the public.
"
p228_321,"Robert is a special talent.
"
p228_322,"A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
"
p228_323,"You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
"
p228_324,"There was no option.
"
p228_325,"The same things will happen with GM foods.
"
p228_326,"It is a sign of hope.
"
p228_327,"Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
"
p228_328,"It has moved on in the last week.
"
p228_329,"The train was on time.
"
p228_330,"It is so unfair.
"
p228_331,"He has to learn.
"
p228_332,"But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
"
p228_333,"I've got no secret.
"
p228_334,"Tiger is the exception.
"
p228_335,"A great deal has been achieved.
"
p228_336,"It was forced to divert.
"
p228_337,"In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
"
p228_338,"This is a friendly match ?
"
p228_339,"I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
"
p228_340,"He's a genius.
"
p228_341,"They should take their mobile phones.
"
p228_342,"It is not like working for a living.
"
p228_343,"It's the last thing on my mind.
"
p228_344,"The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
"
p228_345,"He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
"
p228_346,"That is a break with tradition.
"
p228_347,"She is free.
"
p228_348,"Everyone was in tears.
"
p228_349,"You must have a government and a good civil service.
"
p228_350,"As, indeed, they would be.
"
p228_351,"No other job in world football can compare to this one.
"
