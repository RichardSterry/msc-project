p339_001,Please call Stella.
p339_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p339_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a sack for her brother Bob."
p339_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p339_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p339_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p339_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p339_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p339_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p339_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p339_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p339_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p339_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p339_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p339_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p339_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p339_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p339_018,Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p339_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow."
p339_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p339_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p339_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p339_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p339_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p339_025,They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
p339_026,The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p339_027,Glasgow is far from overload.
p339_028,It's a big mystery.
p339_029,What is a house without it?
p339_030,It was really good in the first week.
p339_031,It's about the balance.
p339_032,"Like his acting, it was an accident."
p339_033,It really has not been their season.
p339_034,I want somebody with something to prove.
p339_035,This would give Scotland around eight members.
p339_036,There was a ban on reporting the trial.
p339_037,I don't think the action was a mistake.
p339_038,You go in there and do it.
p339_039,"We were in Italy  suddenly, we knew."
p339_040,What will happen to them today?
p339_041,I didn't expect to get one.
p339_042,"It was electric, amazing."
p339_043,I said to him.
p339_044,Labour has been found out on public spending.
p339_045,he told a producer.
p339_046,That is not the place for her.
p339_047,The jury is still out on this one.
p339_048,We have to work together.
p339_049,I don't think that he won't be released.
p339_050,"It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act."
p339_051,It means it is difficult.
p339_052,But they were true stories.
p339_053,I needed to get away.
p339_054,I will make that point tonight.
p339_055,Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p339_056,There are two things we have to do.
p339_057,Are they going to work together again?
p339_058,We need to do that every week.
p339_059,It gives us something to work on.
p339_060,But what did it matter?
p339_061,A government is a government is a government.
p339_062,Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.
p339_063,I am not retaining him.
p339_064,The police are not the target.
p339_065,"It has affected it, obviously."
p339_066,But that title is a mistake.
p339_067,And he's not a bigot.
p339_068,But summer is spent.
p339_069,"Services are being expanded, too."
p339_070,It has only been rumours.
p339_071,It is extremely fortunate.
p339_072,Today is the first step in that process.
p339_073,Several others were absent.
p339_074,It is surprising to come back this way.
p339_075,But there was no time for that.
p339_076,A review is under way.
p339_077,That should be fun.
p339_078,Maybe he will act again.
p339_079,What we were doing.
p339_080,What is the Barnett formula?
p339_081,It all happened so suddenly.
p339_082,I won't let that happen.
p339_083,Or have they?
p339_084,There is no change in the strategy.
p339_085,I had a fortunate war.
p339_086,"It will probably be my last, too."
p339_087,I am not completely insane.
p339_088,We spoke about a few people.
p339_089,She had to learn a new discipline.
p339_090,"In fact, he took it very well."
p339_091,I decided to take my time.
p339_092,"Quite a lot of people know that, actually."
p339_093,We did it in one take.
p339_094,He doesn't even know who he is.
p339_095,It is hard to understand.
p339_096,What will it be?
p339_097,The search is due to be completed today.
p339_098,This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p339_099,"What you sow, you have to reap."
p339_100,He is a one-off.
p339_101,Six men will take the decision.
p339_102,To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.
p339_103,We should not be surprised at that.
p339_104,It was a disaster.
p339_105,We have been so lucky.
p339_107,It was a bit of a tightrope.
p339_108,I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p339_109,It was all over now.
p339_110,But it was only a matter of time.
p339_111,I always liked to get a laugh.
p339_112,I still hope to go.
p339_113,Sometimes they come off.
p339_114,We're not that bad.
p339_115,Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.
p339_116,I feel strongly about it.
p339_117,There are exciting days ahead.
p339_118,We have to put this behind us.
p339_119,I thought it was quite good.
p339_120,This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p339_121,"We're very, very happy."
p339_122,There could be a possible connection.
p339_123,But there was everything!
p339_124,We are doing very well as we are.
p339_125,The Scots are great.
p339_126,That imbalance was evident in their play.
p339_127,"However, the drama was not over."
p339_128,But it was not just the land.
p339_129,I don't think the referees are against us.
p339_130,It is too much for me.
p339_131,It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p339_132,We are still waiting.
p339_133,It happened again yesterday.
p339_134,He will be a major challenger next year.
p339_135,That question was never asked.
p339_136,I am not inclined to believe it.
p339_137,It was on fire.
p339_138,I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
p339_139,How can they tell?
p339_140,My ambition is to make the cut.
p339_141,It will be for the committee to decide.
p339_142,Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p339_143,"Rangers must be winners, it says."
p339_144,He was part of the family.
p339_145,I certainly think it should be there.
p339_146,But it does not matter.
p339_147,Hopefully we can put in a performance.
p339_148,"Sadly, he has a point."
p339_149,It was so sad.
p339_150,"Mind you, all was not lost."
p339_151,We were extremely lucky.
p339_152,It was an amazing time.
p339_153,"In fact, the reasons are simple."
p339_154,The hearing is expected to continue today.
p339_155,It is just a matter of time.
p339_156,This news is really depressing.
p339_157,I'm not fit for anything else.
p339_158,"The day may come, but not for a while."
p339_159,The enemy was time.
p339_160,He would have done the same to me.
p339_161,What were they told?
p339_162,More cases are expected.
p339_163,I believe the gap is nearly there.
p339_164,It would be very dangerous.
p339_165,How can they say that?
p339_166,My condition is not bad.
p339_167,Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.
p339_168,"I would like to make an impact, of course."
p339_169,I am confident of the outcome this week.
p339_170,The goal is clear.
p339_171,Just think about the lines.
p339_172,It all depends on the wind.
p339_173,I was very influenced by him.
p339_174,I'm so worried about the roads.
p339_175,This was much worse.
p339_176,This was certainly not about money.
p339_177,"It is simple, but profound."
p339_178,The funding is now there.
p339_179,He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p339_180,A film is different from a book.
p339_181,Within three days he was dead.
p339_182,You'll find out on Saturday.
p339_183,Did they give any good advice?
p339_184,We know that from recent experience.
p339_185,"From day one, we were a family."
p339_186,It separates the men from the boys.
p339_187,This could be wonderful.
p339_188,"He loved it, and so did they."
p339_189,The other was a football match.
p339_190,They have the players to do it.
p339_191,Which is worse?
p339_192,He has made a step forward.
p339_193,That was very important.
p339_194,This will have to change.
p339_195,"First, the programme was unbalanced."
p339_196,It was a very strong metaphor.
p339_197,We are going to have a party.
p339_198,I have no problem with that.
p339_199,The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p339_200,I'm very happy that it exploded.
p339_201,We're all paying for it.
p339_202,Lester was like that.
p339_203,"Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked."
p339_204,That's a matter for them.
p339_205,We were never told it was already decided.
p339_206,It is part of our heritage.
p339_207,It is not a road of life.
p339_208,It is not as simple as that.
p339_209,Everything in the symphony is there.
p339_210,Find them somebody they deserve.
p339_211,It's a big challenge for the audience.
p339_212,"If that's the case, he will struggle."
p339_213,It has certainly paid off for him.
p339_214,We're not getting involved.
p339_215,The lottery has helped.
p339_216,They know the language.
p339_217,The acting left a lot to be desired.
p339_218,We shall be victorious.
p339_219,The quality of work is very impressive.
p339_220,"However, he added there were signs of progress."
p339_221,You cannot do that in a lobby.
p339_222,We will all suffer as a result.
p339_223,"Without doubt, they can win the title."
p339_224,What's it about?
p339_225,We are looking to the future.
p339_226,The signs are positive.
p339_227,I called it right.
p339_228,I see it as my job.
p339_229,I have always believed in myself.
p339_230,It has to be put in context.
p339_231,I think we can get there.
p339_232,I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p339_233,"No, they have played well."
p339_234,The reaction of staff has been fantastic.
p339_235,The answer is obviously no.
p339_236,I'll take it as it comes.
p339_237,I think we're the better side.
p339_238,We act because we must.
p339_239,There are two mysteries.
p339_240,The teacher would have approved.
p339_241,Are you going to win?
p339_242,We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p339_243,I could have been killed on that day.
p339_244,They have to come up with a solution.
p339_245,It is very enjoyable.
p339_246,"Now, that would impress the kids."
p339_247,Did it work?
p339_248,But that is for another day.
p339_249,There is a great carry over value.
p339_250,It was not like that at all.
p339_251,Police are appealing for witnesses.
p339_252,I was very surprised.
p339_253,We all knew they could do it.
p339_254,It's about taking risks.
p339_255,Why is this?
p339_256,He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p339_257,It was indeed a night to remember.
p339_258,There are not too many like him.
p339_259,The memory is there.
p339_260,It was an amazing experience.
p339_261,Nobody has been put on trial.
p339_262,He will go on the bench.
p339_263,The police are hopeless.
p339_264,There are no plans to change this.
p339_265,We are deeply concerned at the announcement.
p339_266,A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p339_267,That's the important thing.
p339_268,Should he resign?
p339_269,They have to live with the risk.
p339_270,"It is, but that's not the point."
p339_271,It was my whole life.
p339_272,It was a classic.
p339_273,This week is a perfect example.
p339_274,"However, it is going to happen."
p339_275,This time it really could happen.
p339_276,That sort of thing is long gone.
p339_277,That includes the equipment?
p339_278,It does nothing for me.
p339_279,That has been lost.
p339_280,But that's another story.
p339_281,I think it has worked.
p339_282,No other family members could be contacted.
p339_283,There is nothing to be gained from that.
p339_284,We're very proud of him and his achievement.
p339_285,But do not rely on it.
p339_286,I made a mistake.
p339_287,What do you want.
p339_288,That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
p339_289,I think we could do well in Europe.
p339_290,"And yet, there has been no great impact."
p339_291,Was that not awful?
p339_292,Yesterday was a statement of intent.
p339_293,I'm not there yet but it is close.
p339_294,But it will not work again.
p339_295,Even then he wanted to deflect attention.
p339_296,I have nothing to say on that.
p339_297,The rest is his own.
p339_298,I have no worry about that.
p339_299,"There has been a fair bit in between, too."
p339_300,Who was on the panel?
p339_301,It turned out to have been three hours.
p339_302,That is exactly right.
p339_303,That is not good for golf!
p339_304,He had planned to sell it.
p339_305,We know the goals will come.
p339_306,But it did not last.
p339_307,They need to look after themselves.
p339_308,"They will be stopped, and they will be punished."
p339_309,She asked for the appointment with me.
p339_310,We have nothing to lose.
p339_311,The first time it was rejected.
p339_312,He did not report it.
p339_313,No-one can take it in.
p339_314,They were following his orders.
p339_315,That is an entirely different discipline.
p339_316,It was an insult.
p339_317,Yet there is hope.
p339_318,Referees in Scotland are very weak.
p339_319,It will not be easy for him.
p339_320,That was a fairy tale.
p339_321,I would love to do that.
p339_322,You'll have to wait and see.
p339_323,It wasn't the issue.
p339_324,The number never came.
p339_325,I really have to go now.
p339_326,We are going to listen to Britain.
p339_327,There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
p339_328,Words are not enough.
p339_329,He is in charge on the pitch.
p339_330,We have expected it.
p339_331,Mr Blair was ready for him.
p339_332,"Well, that was the plan."
p339_333,The problem is fairly serious.
p339_334,No decisions have been taken.
p339_335,We won't do that.
p339_336,It's the body that counts.
p339_337,Sprinters are not fit.
p339_338,This has been coming for weeks and weeks.
p339_339,It's a double whammy.
p339_340,Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p339_341,Let's not make that mistake again.
p339_342,That's why he is the prime minister.
p339_343,Only injury has prevented that happening before.
p339_344,They have to be dealt with.
p339_345,His manager blamed the referee.
p339_346,So what was he really doing?
p339_347,I don't want to go anywhere.
p339_348,How do we get a bigger stage?
p339_349,We're very close to being a good team.
p339_350,I thought their commitment was superb.
p339_351,That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p339_352,My mind is the most important thing now.
p339_353,I had nothing to lose.
p339_354,This is a really serious issue.
p339_355,I thought to myself.
p339_356,Could it be?
p339_357,We're talking to the US.
p339_358,Thereafter they were again in control.
p339_359,It looks as though there is no chance.
p339_360,You have to keep the focus alive.
p339_361,It could have been a ceilidh.
p339_362,I cannot really commit.
p339_363,There are many questions to be answered.
p339_364,"Sadly, so did a couple of errors."
p339_365,This is a new beginning.
p339_366,"There are moments of honesty, too."
p339_367,They will fight for everything.
p339_368,He is doing just that.
p339_369,The night is young.
p339_370,But there are signs of a revival.
p339_371,I thought it was a great game.
p339_372,Just get on with it.
p339_373,Germany also said it was unimpressed.
p339_374,It shows the Government is listening.
p339_375,She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
p339_376,They want it to work.
p339_377,This is a completely new experience for me.
p339_378,They still have a great sense of humour.
p339_379,It decided to blame the media.
p339_380,We have chosen for the patients.
p339_381,He was at the outset of his career.
p339_382,Our position is quite clear.
p339_383,It could now be up to the courts.
p339_384,We can make a difference.
p339_385,This was not a contest.
p339_386,So far the weather has been very pleasant.
p339_387,Breaching that condition was itself an offence.
p339_388,I cannot describe it.
p339_389,It is not designed to kill.
p339_390,He has run a hell of a race.
p339_391,We'll have to be satisfied with it.
p339_392,Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.
p339_393,It is good football in Scotland.
p339_394,There is no other option.
p339_395,You can feel the tension in the air.
p339_396,It is a technique.
p339_397,Is it the shape of things to come?
p339_398,My body is exhausted.
p339_399,It is about more than Scotland.
p339_400,It's not just going to be busy.
p339_401,She was on the edge of breaking point.
p339_402,The first appeared to be successful.
p339_403,She was so supportive.
p339_404,I'm delighted with our performance.
p339_405,We await a decision.
p339_406,It's a matter of balance.
p339_407,It is an investment in our product.
p339_408,Everyone can have their opinion.
p339_409,What would you ask?
p339_410,We have got to deal with it.
p339_411,Where do we spend it?
p339_412,I don't know how she does it.
p339_413,I saw it later in the news.
p339_414,Now we must look to the future.
p339_415,I didn't play badly.
p339_416,We haven't come out of this very well.
p339_417,They are looking for partners.
p339_418,I thought they could have made the gesture.
p339_419,We should have been rewarded for producing.
p339_420,I am also delighted for all the players.
p339_421,"He did very well, but didn't win."
p339_422,There is no shortage of questions.
p339_423,Couldn't see the point.
p339_424,"Which, in effect, it is."
