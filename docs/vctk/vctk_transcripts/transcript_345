p345_001,Please call Stella.
p345_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p345_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p345_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p345_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p345_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p345_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p345_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p345_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p345_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p345_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p345_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p345_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p345_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p345_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p345_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p345_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p345_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p345_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p345_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p345_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p345_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p345_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p345_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p345_025,This is a new era.
p345_026,I want to go home.
p345_027,All the people here are local.
p345_028,The racist abuse was terrible.
p345_029,What is the new religion?
p345_030,The Farmer is called an idiot.
p345_031,It's an amazing landscape!
p345_032,I am prepared to step down.
p345_033,It's a lot of pressure on me.
p345_034,We had to laugh.
p345_035,"It is too pretty, it is too small."
p345_036,We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p345_037,I was completely knackered.
p345_038,I'd rather be singing Verdi.
p345_039,A killer is also on the loose.
p345_040,Rangers are struggling and their team have injuries.
p345_041,You've got to be vigilant.
p345_042,You can see how he made his money.
p345_043,"However, there were some alarming findings."
p345_044,Who wants to be a Millionaire?
p345_045,We would certainly consider the proposals.
p345_046,I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p345_047,His record with England was not good.
p345_048,The opposite is the case.
p345_049,Who would be a referee?
p345_050,"Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game."
p345_051,It was time to act.
p345_052,It's a question of fashion.
p345_053,I could never be cool.
p345_054,We will be paying agency rates.
p345_055,Others said he had gone too far.
p345_056,We expect them to deliver for us.
p345_057,He was between people and God.
p345_058,I've never seen anything like it.
p345_059,They were willing us to get a second.
p345_060,No casualties were reported.
p345_061,The classes are taking place.
p345_062,"If true, it will be the first sign of dissent."
p345_063,The sleeper was six hours late.
p345_064,There will be no threat to the game.
p345_065,It would be a last resort.
p345_066,That is part of athletics.
p345_067,Who would have known.
p345_068,We were caught out.
p345_069,"It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment."
p345_070,I haven't made any definite decisions.
p345_071,I had to lie.
p345_072,Among them is his beloved teacher.
p345_073,Everyone was writing me off.
p345_074,How do we get more people in?
p345_075,The defender made an impressive debut.
p345_076,But her parents will never see her again.
p345_077,Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p345_078,I have nothing to lose.
p345_079,He would have loved it.
p345_080,"We should be capable of managing it, though."
p345_081,It was that kind of afternoon.
p345_082,It is a freedom.
p345_083,What happens next?
p345_084,All our futures will already have been decided.
p345_085,I would have been shot dead in bed.
p345_086,He insisted that his staff were too.
p345_087,They should come clean.
p345_088,He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p345_089,I believe that so strongly.
p345_090,"That, though, is an old story."
p345_091,"Inside, the atmosphere was quiet."
p345_092,They don't work anymore anyway.
p345_093,It's about time something was done about equipment.
p345_094,It was a funny feeling.
p345_095,He was at it again yesterday.
p345_096,You can't go on forever.
p345_097,So far this season this approach is working.
p345_098,"However, his involvement was instant."
p345_099,It has to work.
p345_100,"It was, for me, like a week in heaven."
p345_101,"Certainly, there is much on the agenda."
p345_102,There's something about being cut off.
p345_103,This is his personal life.
p345_104,"I asked for a picture and she said, No problem."
p345_105,"If not, a deal could take many months."
p345_106,It's as eventful as it is momentous.
p345_107,I was going to help with the dinner.
p345_108,Would you pay to come and see it?
p345_109,What are they like?
p345_110,I would probably have to agree with him.
p345_111,They were back in favour with the SAC.
p345_112,He had a moustache.
p345_113,I have been thinking about that this week.
p345_114,Let's get it on.
p345_115,Together they will attempt to express the whole.
p345_116,Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.
p345_117,It is really good news.
p345_118,We just want a fair deal.
p345_119,I'll just have to live with that.
p345_120,Neither of them was badly hurt.
p345_121,He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.
p345_122,We wanted it left for a wee while.
p345_123,"At the moment, the success in Germany is good."
p345_124,It is sad and frustrating.
p345_125,Our intentions are real.
p345_126,The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p345_127,Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.
p345_128,She has left the island.
p345_129,That will be the case on Tuesday.
p345_130,"As to rugby, well, no-one knows."
p345_131,It certainly should not be used too often.
p345_132,The whole matter is done and dusted.
p345_133,I don't know where that one came from.
p345_134,The shooting created panic in the street.
p345_135,He would just say it was terrible.
p345_136,Our destiny is in our own hands.
p345_137,That's not fair to the supporters.
p345_138,I was on my own.
p345_139,They were part of our own family.
p345_140,It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.
p345_141,I don't have any perspective on it.
p345_142,Scotland has lost a great man.
p345_143,"Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people."
p345_144,"In fact, they will not be disciplined."
p345_145,His name has not been released.
p345_146,"For some, it was more painful than others."
p345_147,It plainly does not work.
p345_148,His words were not audible.
p345_149,That's a huge amount.
p345_150,"See the amazing arrogance of this, they say."
p345_151,It was even worse than at home.
p345_152,I still think he will win.
p345_153,But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p345_154,Normally it would be four minutes.
p345_155,It may have been a cry for help.
p345_156,But the damage had been done.
p345_157,"No, you couldn't make it up."
p345_158,We are trying to clarify the issues.
p345_159,"However, he did not stay there very long."
p345_160,And so they have.
p345_161,I have a great respect for her.
p345_162,I suggest a new plan.
p345_163,IT takes the biscuit.
p345_164,But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
p345_165,We don't have a solution to the problem.
p345_166,Miller was every bit as happy.
p345_167,The result is utterly compelling.
p345_168,But it won't be the same.
p345_169,"Other forces were, however, at work."
p345_170,Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
p345_171,It is a hobby for me.
p345_172,If only the acting profession was that simple.
p345_173,It was like a kick in the belly.
p345_174,Bombing is the easy option.
p345_175,We should have gone solo.
p345_176,"Directing, if you like."
p345_177,That will be the case.
p345_178,"Now, it's all right."
p345_179,All will be revealed in due course.
p345_180,They have known the hard times.
p345_181,We don't know what happened.
p345_182,You cannot enter the clubhouse.
p345_183,They had seven children.
p345_184,That in itself is an erotic experience.
p345_185,Death is outside the language.
p345_186,You have a plan?
p345_187,It's all too early.
p345_188,Everything in the world was focused on London.
p345_189,We've seen that time and time again.
p345_190,"I was never alone with her, right?"
p345_191,It's not only my respect for them.
p345_192,Tonight's matches European Championship.
p345_193,This is a very high price.
p345_194,That's when you hope to take advantage.
p345_195,I never want to have any children.
p345_196,Business has never been so bad.
p345_197,There is no way to do this.
p345_198,Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
p345_199,I know my sons.
p345_200,Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p345_201,It was too close to call.
p345_202,But who is the killer?
p345_203,"No, it's never been mentioned."
p345_204,Things were so intense in the studio.
p345_205,"The devil, of course, will be in the detail."
p345_206,Then another one came.
p345_207,Progress is being made but it is slow.
p345_208,Everything has been destroyed.
p345_209,The Lobby is not failing.
p345_210,But it is looking very positive.
p345_211,Drugs are getting through.
p345_212,He would have come into the house.
p345_213,I want to put myself on discussion also.
p345_214,It happens in real life.
p345_215,"At the time, he was a living legend."
p345_216,And we will do it.
p345_217,It's a human tragedy.
p345_218,But we are losing that connection.
p345_219,I am going to fight to the end.
p345_220,Either group is living in fantasy land.
p345_221,It's the right thing.
p345_222,That was a disgraceful performance.
p345_223,Must have been at the bar.
p345_224,But this is just the start.
p345_225,I can't get away from it.
p345_226,I believe in the Union.
p345_227,SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p345_228,But he is not hopeful.
p345_229,It will be all about the Olympics.
p345_230,They are very frightened.
p345_231,We have all been there at some point.
p345_232,This is my homeland.
p345_233,The game was up.
p345_234,That is not an easy thing.
p345_235,Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p345_236,I didn't know where they were.
p345_237,Rangers are my life.
p345_238,Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p345_239,"Three weeks later, he resigned."
p345_240,There are two options.
p345_241,I can't describe it.
p345_242,Surely it should be the other way round.
p345_243,There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p345_244,"I get on him, he gets on me."
p345_245,This is wonderful news.
p345_246,I am appalled by this news.
p345_247,No injuries were reported.
p345_248,"It is not surprising, but it is appaling."
p345_249,It is understood he had been stabbed.
p345_250,It's too much work.
p345_251,We were extremely arrogant.
p345_252,"Actually, it's an amazing orchestra."
p345_253,THE waiting game continues.
p345_254,Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p345_255,I don't think he was being very fair.
p345_256,You've got to fight to stay up.
p345_257,But the foundations have been laid.
p345_258,We're looking for unity in the council.
p345_259,The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p345_260,What is so unusual about this case?
p345_261,Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
p345_262,But this is different.
p345_263,I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p345_264,It doesn't look good.
p345_265,That will not change.
p345_267,Her presence was almost everywhere.
p345_268,Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
p345_269,It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
p345_270,There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
p345_271,They've been at it for five hours.
p345_272,This action could have been avoided.
p345_273,The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p345_274,And they still have the final to come.
p345_275,Anyone else can apply.
p345_276,He looked like a schoolboy.
p345_277,It was like the old days.
p345_278,But that is about to change.
p345_279,The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
p345_280,We can build on that.
p345_281,It could be a danger.
p345_282,We are not going to be complacent.
p345_283,"The only problem was, they were on himself."
p345_284,His body was found in May.
p345_285,He's a joy to follow.
p345_286,Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p345_287,I'm sure you all can relate to that.
p345_288,My wife is coming over at the weekend.
p345_289,"Sure, he is the best player in the world."
p345_290,It starts to get you down.
p345_291,I don't think we could have expected better.
p345_292,My life has been turned upside down.
p345_293,Somebody has to speak up for common sense.
p345_294,But they miss the whole point.
p345_295,You have to count on other people.
p345_296,"I said, What was that about?"
p345_297,Immediate action must be taken.
p345_298,This could prove a problem.
p345_299,I was a local hero.
p345_300,"He is an excellent defender, strong and quick."
p345_301,It will be extremely difficult for him.
p345_302,It's a gigantic con.
p345_303,Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p345_304,This club have been fair to me.
p345_305,I didn't know she could do that.
p345_306,What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p345_307,This is too much like Scotland.
p345_308,I can't say anything about any figure.
p345_309,A counter reaction was.
p345_310,That goes back a long way.
p345_311,I wouldn't have had the abandon.
p345_312,"She has fallen in love with Scotland, however."
p345_313,They were not missing much.
p345_314,It should not make the same mistake again.
p345_315,Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
p345_316,The record companies have gone through the floor.
p345_317,It's always a dilemma.
p345_318,"As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax."
p345_319,Is she in trouble?
p345_320,It is a symbolic concert.
p345_321,"They were the best team, but unlucky in the end."
p345_322,It is a very beautiful city.
p345_323,"She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated."
p345_324,But could it afford to run it?
p345_325,I am very happy with him.
p345_326,I was waiting for that question.
p345_327,Her body was found on Monday morning.
p345_328,I am not against a further inquiry.
p345_329,"His father said, My son was lucky."
p345_330,WHO would have thought it?
p345_331,We will win the argument.
p345_332,"Five years later, the deception continued."
p345_333,I might get an injury very easily.
p345_334,I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p345_335,Stock markets will be watching closely.
p345_336,I just want to do the good work.
p345_337,I'm very happy tonight.
p345_338,He was overwhelmed by the response.
p345_339,Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p345_340,Now it was serious.
p345_341,This is his first movie.
p345_342,He is already in place.
p345_343,No one would believe him.
p345_344,We live in shorthand.
p345_345,But something has been lost in the translation.
p345_346,Spent three months alone at sea.
p345_347,I made a big mistake.
p345_348,I just know it's a lot.
p345_349,I saw one body.
p345_350,I am very happy.
p345_351,There was no discussion about it.
p345_352,"Three hours later, the man was free."
p345_353,It was a very big win for us.
p345_354,I've never felt affection for Emu.
p345_355,Everything is up for grabs.
p345_356,We had a good time.
p345_357,"I was utterly hopeless at it, it must be said."
p345_358,This was a good performance.
p345_359,"However, the snow was welcomed by some."
p345_360,It is not simple.
p345_361,We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p345_362,Our task is to complete the picture.
p345_363,It is a road of death.
p345_364,"The Government would be ready, they said."
p345_365,Her life is now back on track.
p345_366,I said at the time it was wrong.
p345_367,By now he was very ill with cancer.
p345_368,"Anything that was going, really."
p345_369,He will take it in his stride.
p345_370,I don't believe a word of it.
p345_371,I couldn't put my finger on it.
p345_372,People can really get themselves in a mess.
p345_373,The winner will be announced in December.
p345_374,This is bound to happen.
p345_375,"Suddenly, there was an audience."
p345_376,It has not yet opened to pupils.
p345_377,The letters are going out today.
p345_378,I did not name it.
p345_379,And therein lies the problem.
p345_380,"I also thought, This is a feature film."
p345_381,McMaster had already seen the first part.
p345_382,Or is it?
p345_383,Is he going to look after them?
p345_384,They are appealing for witnesses.
p345_385,"This is the last chance, and everyone knows it."
p345_386,It is quite simple.
p345_389,It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p345_390,His instructions were clear.
p345_391,There is ample evidence.
p345_392,It was a game we had to win.
p345_393,I've never had problems with any football managers.
p345_394,To begin with it looks good.
p345_395,I won't go back to Holland.
p345_396,There is still a long way to go.
p345_397,"Almost overnight, he found his voice."
p345_398,This was a unique election.
p345_399,It was still there last night.
p345_400,"In his absence, the council adopted the change."
