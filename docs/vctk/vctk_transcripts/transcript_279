p279_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p279_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p279_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p279_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p279_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p279_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p279_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p279_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p279_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p279_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p279_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p279_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p279_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p279_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p279_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p279_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p279_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p279_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p279_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p279_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p279_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p279_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p279_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p279_025,"It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
"
p279_026,"He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
"
p279_027,"The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
"
p279_028,"They should be so lucky.
"
p279_029,"Is this accurate?
"
p279_030,"I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
"
p279_031,"There's a story, too.
"
p279_032,"People love to see this stuff.
"
p279_033,"He took me on a tour of the wards.
"
p279_034,"Horses are drawn by ballot.
"
p279_035,"It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.

p279_036,"They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
"
p279_037,"They're just different.
"
p279_038,"Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
"
p279_039,"Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
"
p279_040,"President Bush is at war.
"
p279_041,"She is believed to be in South Africa.
"
p279_042,"I was scared.
"
p279_043,"Dancing was her life.
"
p279_044,"It will come all right.
"
p279_045,"It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
"
p279_046,"We will push.
"
p279_047,"That period was a struggle.
"
p279_048,"It is urgent.
"
p279_049,"It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
"
p279_050,"The judge said.
"
p279_051,"Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
"
p279_052,"We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
"
p279_053,"It's a blessing.
"
p279_054,"But it might have done.
"
p279_055,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p279_056,"As she explains.
"
p279_057,"Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
"

"
p279_061,"Here's a clue.
"
p279_062,"He had no enemies.
"
p279_063,"Sadly, it can't.
"
p279_064,"We have not given up hope.
"
p279_065,"Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
"
p279_066,"That's the truth.
"
p279_067,"They were too hard.
"
p279_068,"The problems are a result of that shortfall.
"
p279_069,"Art is extra.
"
p279_070,"They're appalled by that.
"
p279_071,"George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
"
p279_072,"Scotland had great assets.
"
p279_073,"He was popular.
"
p279_074,"Have a look at our accounts.
"
p279_075,"It is like a river running by my home.
"
p279_076,"The end result is precisely the same.
"
p279_077,"It seemed so personal.
"
p279_078,"Painful, but only because it's true.
"
p279_079,"He had been a singer.
"
p279_080,"I've been there.

"
p279_083,"She died in hospital two hours later.
"
p279_084,"Is there a new way forward?
"
p279_085,"It works for us.
"
p279_086,"It is a time bomb.
"
p279_087,"This is the way things should be handled.
"
p279_088,"The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
"
p279_089,"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
"
p279_090,"Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
"
p279_091,"Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
"
p279_092,"They lived for their children.
"
p279_093,"Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
"
p279_094,"Yet, it worked.
"
p279_095,"This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
"
p279_096,"It is an old family habit.
"
p279_097,"Until you hit the big games.
"
p279_098,"The peace process will be buried!
"
p279_099,"The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
"
p279_100,"We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
"
p279_101,"The selection process is still at a very early stage.
"
p279_102,"However, we have not come to any conclusions.
"
p279_103,"After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
"
p279_104,"I see no need for change.
"
p279_105,"That would be unlawful.
"
p279_106,"I didn't play well last year.
"
p279_107,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p279_108,"They will want to perform well.
"
p279_109,"For these people, the ruling is very welcome.

"
p279_111,"O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
"
p279_112,"Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
"
p279_113,"I was angry.
"
p279_114,"This is a step backwards.
"
p279_115,"We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
"
p279_116,"This film will be totally awesome.
"
p279_117,"My office is bare.
"
p279_118,"Does this mean.
"
p279_119,"They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
"
p279_120,"That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
"
p279_121,"Who would have?
"
p279_122,"Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
"
p279_123,"We work on the same level.
"
p279_124,"You can spend money on housing.
"
p279_125,"I felt very strongly that England should have it.
"
p279_126,"Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
"
p279_127,"I'm so angry.
"
p279_128,"Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
"
p279_129,"Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
"
p279_130,"Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
"
p279_131,"Well, you can have a tree.
"
p279_132,"We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
"
p279_133,"Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
"
p279_134,"It will be too hot.
"
p279_135,"The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
"
p279_136,"I am now unemployed.
"
p279_137,"You've got to be vigilant.
"
p279_138,"It's perfectly feasible.
"
p279_139,"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
"
p279_140,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p279_141,"That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
"
p279_142,"And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
"
p279_143,"We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
"
p279_144,"Is that Titanic?
"
p279_145,"That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
"
p279_146,"It is like a football team.
"
p279_147,"I am just trying to do my job.
"
p279_148,"They did very well.
"
p279_149,"You know the type.
"
p279_150,"In each case they were a goal down.
"
p279_151,"The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
"
p279_152,"A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
"
p279_153,"It was the same at Twickenham.
"
p279_154,"We also enjoyed a lot of support.
"
p279_155,"He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
"
p279_156,"This latter point is hugely important.
"
p279_157,"I am very happy with life.
"
p279_158,"These days are long gone.
"
p279_159,"It is an attitude of mind.
"
p279_160,"But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
"
p279_161,"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
"
p279_162,"As, indeed, they would be.
"
p279_163,"I have got a wife to feed.
"
p279_164,"We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
"
p279_165,"Tell it like it was?
"
p279_166,"It is not too late to get on board.
"
p279_167,"It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
"
p279_168,"By then, however, both men were already in the US.
"
p279_169,"Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
"
p279_170,"Nobody did in those days.
"
p279_171,"My life has been destroyed.
"
p279_172,"His team management was protective.
"
p279_173,"Is Saddam a threat?
"
p279_174,"We wanted it left for a wee while.
"
p279_175,"But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
"
p279_176,"It is not either national standards or local control.
"
p279_177,"The clarity is vital.
"
p279_178,"The hotel was now for sale.
"
p279_179,"I drove the ball well.
"
p279_180,"That has been the easy part.
"
p279_181,"Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
"
p279_182,"No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
"
p279_183,"Government will intervene.
"
p279_184,"We knew nothing about it.
"
p279_185,"Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
"
p279_186,"It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
"
p279_187,"It's a joke.
"
p279_188,"Does this matter?
"
p279_189,"It just came into my head that day.
"
p279_190,"My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
"
p279_191,"It was an odd affair, in many respects.
"
p279_192,"It is tough, but possible.
"
p279_193,"We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
"
p279_194,"The procedure is the same in all cases.
"
p279_195,"Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
"
p279_196,"The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
"
p279_197,"It was typical.
"
p279_198,"Our strategy is straightforward.
"
p279_199,"There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
"
p279_200,"I have a cold.
"
p279_201,"Tommy is not a problem.
"
p279_202,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p279_203,"The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
"
p279_204,"He had suffered a heart attack.
"
p279_205,"The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
"
p279_206,"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
"
p279_207,"Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
"
p279_208,"There was no rescue.
"
p279_209,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p279_210,"I don't want to use it.
"
p279_211,"This gives a financial incentive to switch.
"
p279_212,"The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
"
p279_213,"The road was closed for several hours.
"
p279_214,"That is an important part of our role.
"
p279_215,"Twaddle is a case in point.
"
p279_216,"I am delighted for Simon.
"
p279_217,"By hard work, is the answer.
"
p279_218,"I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
"
p279_219,"However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
"
p279_220,"His death was a tragic accident.
"
p279_221,"He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
"
p279_222,"He's a nice guy.
"
p279_223,"But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
"
p279_224,"A career as a doctor is on hold.
"
p279_225,"I am immensely sad.
"
p279_226,"I'd never seen a play about me.
"
p279_227,"It is a gamble.
"
p279_228,"My neighbours are horrified.
"
p279_229,"At the time, he was a living legend.
"
p279_230,"Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
"
p279_231,"They are the innocent victims.
"
p279_232,"Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
"
p279_233,"Broke the birdie record.
"
p279_234,"Police later said the scheme would end in November.
"
p279_235,"It is set in Paris.
"
p279_236,"They should come forward.
"
p279_237,"It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
"
p279_238,"Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
"
p279_239,"You take a risk.
"
p279_240,"It's too much work.
"
p279_241,"The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
"
p279_242,"It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
"
p279_243,"He will go a long way.
"
p279_244,"We did not compete with any other local farmer.
"
p279_245,"The scene is about this?
"
p279_246,"It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
"
p279_247,"We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
"
p279_248,"He's a lovely young man.
"
p279_249,"There will be widespread support on all sides.
"
p279_250,"This year I understood.
"
p279_251,"This is the culture change in medicine.
"
p279_252,"He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
"
p279_253,"He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
"
p279_254,"For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
"
p279_255,"It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
"
p279_256,"That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
"
p279_257,"This is a big club.
"
p279_258,"Blair is very positive at European Councils.
"
p279_259,"they fail to engage.
"
p279_260,"People should not become complacent.
"
p279_261,"The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
"
p279_262,"The warning is timely.
"
p279_263,"Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
"
p279_264,"Blood samples were taken.
"
p279_265,"It looks as though he will be right.
"
p279_266,"Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
"
p279_267,"I am totally horrified by the sentence.
"
p279_268,"It's very nice.
"
p279_269,"It left me with a sadness.
"
p279_270,"It was an easy decision to come here.
"
p279_271,"It is the same in Sweden.
"
p279_272,"That could be in place by next year.
"
p279_273,"Things can change.
"
p279_274,"A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
"
p279_275,"The script was funny.
"
p279_276,"They seem to get away with it.
"
p279_277,"She looked so young.
"
p279_278,"It happens from time to time.
"
p279_279,"For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
"
p279_280,"They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured.
"
p279_281,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p279_282,"I intended to look for another club on loan.
"
p279_283,"You've got to have both sides.
"
p279_284,"The attacker died in the crash.
"
p279_285,"It was a virus.
"
p279_286,"Maloney is an engaging talent.
"
p279_287,"Who will perform?
"
p279_288,"It's like a high school play.
"
p279_289,"It was hopeless.
"
p279_290,"I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
"
p279_291,"She said she could not believe that they had run away.
"
p279_292,"He wrote the letter two days before he died.
"
p279_293,"It changed my life.
"
p279_294,"These figures are truly awful.
"
p279_295,"He should have won.
"
p279_296,"Sunday's game was not a trial.
"
p279_297,"Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
"
p279_298,"What has altered?
"
p279_299,"Graeme was prepared.
"
p279_300,"I thought it was my only chance.
"
p279_301,"One was a lawyer.
"
p279_302,"The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
"
p279_303,"They are wrong.
"
p279_304,"This is a war over our home.
"
p279_305,"In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
"
p279_306,"Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
"
p279_307,"It was entirely justified.
"
p279_308,"They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
"
p279_309,"It's certainly different.
"
p279_310,"The letters are going out today.
"
p279_311,"I did not name it.
"
p279_312,"The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
"
p279_313,"Special measures were needed.
"
p279_314,"It is all credit to them today.
"
p279_315,"They were fantastic.
"
p279_316,"Craig is a major concern for us.
"
p279_317,"My body is clearly capable.
"
p279_318,"I came into this world with nothing.
"
p279_319,"The airport was even different.
"
p279_320,"Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
"
p279_321,"But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
"
p279_322,"He got the same story.
"
p279_323,"They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
"
p279_324,"He was then replaced by Ross.
"
p279_325,"She did not attend the courtroom.
"
p279_326,"You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
"
p279_327,"In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
"
p279_328,"Was this element always there?
"
p279_329,"They haven't got a hope.
"
p279_330,"He did a good job.
"
p279_331,"I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
"
p279_332,"It is so unfair.
"
p279_333,"It will be very, very tight.
"
p279_334,"That is the very reason why it was so vital.
"
p279_335,"In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
"
p279_336,"The composer will conduct.
"
p279_337,"It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
"
p279_338,"Alex Ferguson is the same.
"
p279_339,"The boat was fantastic.
"
p279_340,"I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
"
p279_341,"Like his acting, it was an accident.
"
p279_342,"A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
"
p279_343,"You need a licence to run a pub.
"
p279_344,"The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
"
p279_345,"The salary changes are long overdue.
"
p279_346,"The decision is an absolute disgrace.
"
p279_347,"It is horrible.
"
p279_348,"The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
"
p279_349,"I kept going for her.
"
p279_350,"He has seen the past.
"
p279_351,"Hartley should know.
"
p279_352,"We are looking for perfection.
"
