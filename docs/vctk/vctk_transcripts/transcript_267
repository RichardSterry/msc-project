p267_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p267_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p267_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p267_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p267_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p267_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p267_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p267_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p267_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p267_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p267_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p267_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p267_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p267_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p267_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p267_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p267_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p267_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p267_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p267_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p267_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p267_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p267_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p267_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p267_025,"A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
"
p267_026,"He may not need to force that message.
"
p267_027,"There is no reason at all.
"
p267_028,"Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
"
p267_029,"Because we do not need it.
"
p267_030,"We will look into it.
"
p267_031,"This is a central issue.
"
p267_032,"Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
"
p267_033,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p267_034,"I became a widow overnight.
"
p267_035,"You must always attempt to raise the bar.
"
p267_036,"A week is a long time in politics.
"
p267_037,"Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
"
p267_038,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p267_039,"She hopes to study in Britain one day.
"
p267_040,"It is difficult for Ali.
"
p267_041,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p267_042,"He is too weak to move.
"
p267_043,"Everything else is a bonus.
"
p267_044,"This is the interesting part.
"
p267_045,"I guess I was lucky, though.
"
p267_046,"Pulled a huge number of viewers.
"
p267_047,"Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
"
p267_048,"There was no safety net.
"
p267_049,"They just thought it was extremely good acting.
"
p267_050,"It is a different animal.
"
p267_051,"The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
"
p267_052,"I must take a seat.
"
p267_053,"In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
"
p267_054,"Four other charges were dropped.
"
p267_055,"So I liked the challenge.
"
p267_056,"He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
"
p267_057,"That way I won't have to do anything.
"
p267_058,"It's just the timing of the game.
"
p267_059,"Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
"
p267_060,"We need to increase the membership.
"
p267_061,"He was at home with his pals.
"
p267_062,"They are in the euro.
"
p267_063,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p267_064,"How are you, sir ?
"
p267_065,"So is that it, then ?
"
p267_066,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p267_067,"There could be a way back.
"
p267_068,"They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
"
p267_069,"Her body was found on Monday morning.
"
p267_070,"They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
"
p267_071,"Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
"
p267_072,"A government is a government is a government.
"
p267_073,"Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
"
p267_074,"That is bound to happen.
"
p267_075,"He is in the queue.
"
p267_076,"He seems to be pleased with the picture.
"
p267_077,"Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
"
p267_078,"He can win every week.
"
p267_079,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p267_080,"It's so hard to shift.
"
p267_081,"They lived for their children.
"
p267_082,"The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
"
p267_083,"There was no way back for United after that.
"
p267_084,"This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
"
p267_085,"That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
"
p267_086,"They need to find a form of words.
"
p267_087,"A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
"
p267_088,"It's for that reason he should resign.
"
p267_089,"The rescue package is public money.
"
p267_090,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p267_091,"Our house was very small.
"
p267_092,"They were a lovely couple.
"
p267_093,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p267_094,"It's not a lack of effort.
"
p267_095,"That means an extra two years.
"
p267_096,"Then came the collision with Sergio.
"
p267_097,"It is a total and utter change of culture.
"
p267_098,"Sport is good for you.
"
p267_099,"We need to handle it.
"
p267_100,"They will notice a difference.
"
p267_102,"Such actions are rarely popular.
"
p267_103,"He has done that with a great deal to spare.
"
p267_104,"Then again, we could have.
"
p267_105,"She's got to say something.
"
p267_106,"I was always a little behind.
"
p267_107,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p267_108,"That admission is not surprising.
"
p267_109,"We have a training class.
"
p267_110,"Well, you can have a tree.
"
p267_111,"Becoming a father was wonderful.
"
p267_112,"I was on a roll.
"
p267_113,"What do we do ?
"
p267_114,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p267_115,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p267_116,"The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
"
p267_117,"Something will be done by corporate bodies.
"
p267_118,"We did what we had to do.
"
p267_119,"I am the Son of Sam.
"
p267_120,"You've got to be vigilant.
"
p267_121,"Tiger is not the norm.
"
p267_122,"My conscience is not clear.
"
p267_123,"Nobody in the world can get away from him.
"
p267_124,"It would make a lot of sense.
"
p267_125,"They could use a boost.
"
p267_126,"He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
"
p267_127,"Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
"
p267_128,"They scored with a penalty and a breakaway.
"
p267_129,"He was seen as the enemy.
"
p267_130,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p267_131,"Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
"
p267_132,"Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
"
p267_133,"It was a piece of art.
"
p267_134,"I am just trying to do my job.
"
p267_135,"So I got a blood test.
"
p267_136,"It has become a way of life.
"
p267_137,"I was caught out a little bit.
"
p267_138,"The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
"
p267_139,"It has to be an event.
"
p267_140,"It was deployed in the Gulf War.
"
p267_141,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p267_142,"She had gone to the Catholic school.
"
p267_143,"It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
"
p267_144,"It was by the numbers.
"
p267_145,"We will turn the corner.
"
p267_146,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p267_147,"Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
"
p267_148,"There was a definite prejudice.
"
p267_149,"Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
"
p267_150,"Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
"
p267_151,"Adams is surely worth a chance.
"
p267_152,"That is not too bad.
"
p267_153,"We are still getting over it.
"
p267_154,"As, indeed, they would be.
"
p267_155,"We came across the first set of bodies.
"
p267_156,"Seven people were later detained by police.
"
p267_157,"I would probably have to agree with him.
"
p267_158,"We were given a warm and friendly reception.
"
p267_159,"However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
"
p267_160,"Nobody did in those days.
"
p267_161,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p267_162,"And does it ?
"
p267_163,"Are you from the rugby ?
"
p267_164,"Had I heard ?
"
p267_165,"Well, this article is a bit like that.
"
p267_166,"It's nice to be nice.
"
p267_167,"The people are the hero.
"
p267_168,"I always felt they played for me.
"
p267_169,"It is premature to speculate on the impact.
"
p267_170,"They made such decisions in London.
"
p267_171,"It is a body blow.
"
p267_172,"First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
"
p267_173,"It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
"
p267_174,"It is not a threat.
"
p267_175,"I would not count on it.
"
p267_176,"He played it like a veteran.
"
p267_177,"I have spoken to head office.
"
p267_178,"The referee had a good game.
"
p267_179,"The European Union is a case in point.
"
p267_180,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p267_181,"It is a common problem.
"
p267_182,"A team is a team.
"
p267_183,"Aberdeen had little to offer.
"
p267_184,"It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
"
p267_185,"It was a pre-emptive strike.
"
p267_186,"A terrorist is a terrorist.
"
p267_187,"People will ask about us.
"
p267_188,"I had come back from London.
"
p267_189,"This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
"
p267_190,"It's very difficult to find a buyer.
"
p267_191,"Final proposals will be published in February.
"
p267_192,"Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
"
p267_193,"If I was a woman.
"
p267_194,"I came home by ambulance.
"
p267_195,"I suggest a new plan.
"
p267_196,"The conference is the first test.
"
p267_197,"Tommy is not a problem.
"
p267_198,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p267_199,"He had suffered a heart attack.
"
p267_200,"I won't make an official complaint.
"
p267_201,"A bit of match fitness is required.
"
p267_202,"It is an impressive record.
"
p267_203,"There is no quick fix.
"
p267_204,"Abbey National is an option.
"
p267_205,"It has been like that all year for me.
"
p267_206,"HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
"
p267_207,"Today we must not repeat that mistake.
"
p267_208,"From there, they can go anywhere.
"
p267_209,"I had relied on him.
"
p267_210,"The course has helped a lot.
"
p267_211,"I'm just a regular person.
"
p267_212,"My life is in the ballet.
"
p267_213,"He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
"
p267_214,"They're going to open in early summer.
"
p267_215,"Anyway, the job will be part-time.
"
p267_216,"I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
"
p267_217,"It is good for our team.
"
p267_218,"It was a crazy day.
"
p267_219,"Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
"
p267_220,"Because they didn't want to know.
"
p267_221,"Women were mostly notable by their absence.
"
p267_222,"You have to do your research.
"
p267_223,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p267_224,"Does the name matter ?
"
p267_225,"how do you get it back ?
"
p267_226,"What are you not good at ?
"
p267_227,"William Hague delighted his party.
"
p267_228,"You could feel the heat.
"
p267_229,"Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
"
p267_230,"The boy is no longer with us.
"
p267_231,"I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
"
p267_232,"A small number of new jobs will also be created.
"
p267_233,"My wife and family are the support system.
"
p267_234,"And he goes with it.
"
p267_235,"They tried to give her advice.
"
p267_236,"Pensions are a long-term investment.
"
p267_237,"She died in middle age.
"
p267_238,"I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
"
p267_239,"Those overseas offices were great.
"
p267_240,"You will have seen the adverts.
"
p267_242,"It is the loss of my name.
"
p267_243,"The irony was not lost.
"
p267_244,"We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
"
p267_245,"I am still waiting for a reply.
"
p267_246,"It is a court case.
"
p267_247,"He has been a success this year.
"
p267_248,"It might be sad, but it's a fact.
"
p267_249,"He declined to give any details.
"
p267_250,"It seems a waste of talents.
"
p267_251,"Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
"
p267_252,"If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
"
p267_253,"His is a global perspective.
"
p267_254,"It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
"
p267_255,"In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
"
p267_256,"Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
"
p267_257,"It was a cry for help.
"
p267_258,"They were back in full training yesterday.
"
p267_259,"No production contract is yet in sight.
"
p267_260,"Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
"
p267_261,"There will be widespread support on all sides.
"
p267_262,"The capital costs are modest.
"
p267_263,"It was the climax of the thing.
"
p267_264,"I can't get a job.
"
p267_265,"I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
"
p267_266,"On the contrary they stand to gain.
"
p267_267,"This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
"
p267_268,"It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
"
p267_269,"It does not work that way in Scottish football.
"
p267_270,"It is also very valuable.
"
p267_271,"It disappeared into the cup.
"
p267_272,"The stage was set for a showdown.
"
p267_273,"Not many companies can say that these days.
"
p267_274,"He will emerge as a world leader.
"
p267_275,"We're trying to get rounded performers.
"
p267_276,"A lot of their players have developed in the English league.
"
p267_277,"It has the potential to be another North Sea.
"
p267_278,"It is set in Paris.
"
p267_279,"He has run a hell of a race.
"
p267_280,"It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
"
p267_281,"He was also married with two children.
"
p267_282,"It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
"
p267_283,"It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
"
p267_284,"They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
"
p267_285,"That goes back a long way.
"
p267_286,"And they were being paid ?
"
p267_287,"was everything done to save people ?
"
p267_288,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p267_289,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p267_290,"Stephen will get his first cap.
"
p267_291,"They were on holiday in Egypt.
"
p267_292,"The partnership was set up during the summer.
"
p267_293,"We have a plan in place.
"
p267_294,"I felt like I was a child.
"
p267_295,"Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
"
p267_296,"He wants to talk a lot.
"
p267_297,"The attacker died in the crash.
"
p267_298,"It is inherent in society.
"
p267_299,"He refused to name the survivors.
"
p267_300,"It's difficult to predict the future.
"
p267_301,"That is the general feeling.
"
p267_302,"I am a retailer by nature.
"
p267_303,"Well, he can do it.
"
p267_304,"The weather forecast isn't good.
"
p267_305,"The judge was really nice.
"
p267_306,"Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
"
p267_307,"It is a potential danger.
"
p267_308,"The tournament has now been cancelled.
"
p267_309,"Cast Away now on general release.
"
p267_310,"It is a road of death.
"
p267_311,"We will make a statement tomorrow.
"
p267_312,"There were no passengers on board.
"
p267_313,"You will never get a conviction.
"
p267_314,"I will not be afraid.
"
p267_316,"He has left the company.
"
p267_317,"I am not concerned with protection of the public.
"
p267_318,"People can really get themselves in a mess.
"
p267_319,"I would do away with the dress code.
"
p267_320,"He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
"
p267_321,"He has been told by the doctor to rest.
"
p267_322,"We want to play at the worlds.
"
p267_323,"After some discussion they did.
"
p267_325,"It is all credit to them today.
"
p267_326,"The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
"
p267_327,"You are looking at him.
"
p267_328,"This is a source of real concern for the area.
"
p267_329,"It's not an easy life.
"
p267_330,"The election is total confusion and chaos.
"
p267_331,"It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
"
p267_332,"The problems began a long time ago.
"
p267_333,"It makes a compelling display.
"
p267_334,"That is a trend which will be encouraged.
"
p267_335,"But the New Year was special.
"
p267_336,"They are now out in the cold.
"
p267_337,"There was no time scale.
"
p267_338,"Does that put pressure on us ?
"
p267_339,"Did it work ?
"
p267_340,"Do you think we are a top nation ?
"
p267_341,"It was tough to contain the excitement.
"
p267_342,"It is a strong case.
"
p267_343,"A report is expected next month.
"
p267_344,"The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
"
p267_345,"They were the acts of men.
"
p267_346,"It wasn't a flight of fancy.
"
p267_347,"He was then replaced by Ross.
"
p267_348,"Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
"
p267_349,"He is not very big, either.
"
p267_350,"I have a moral dilemma.
"
p267_351,"This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
"
p267_352,"Finally, he paid for the movie.
"
p267_353,"Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
"
p267_354,"Some will be deployed on submarines.
"
p267_355,"He did a good job.
"
p267_356,"It intends to do so on Wednesday.
"
p267_357,"It is a stroke of genius.
"
p267_358,"In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
"
p267_359,"We live on an island.
"
p267_360,"George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
"
p267_361,"They have created a business.
"
