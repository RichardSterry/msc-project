p361_001,Please call Stella.
p361_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p361_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p361_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p361_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p361_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p361_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p361_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p361_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p361_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p361_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p361_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p361_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p361_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p361_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p361_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p361_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p361_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p361_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p361_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p361_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p361_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p361_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p361_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p361_025,Something has to be done.
p361_026,That is where the damage has been done.
p361_027,He may not need to force that message.
p361_028,These decisions are not simple.
p361_029,The results were very clear.
p361_030,We must convince the citizens.
p361_031,I decided it is going to be William.
p361_032,But we need to keep it there.
p361_033,It is a case of taking a risk.
p361_034,I am really ready for it now.
p361_035,He was jailed for four years.
p361_036,We felt it was sufficient.
p361_037,This decision is folly.
p361_038,And this was well known?
p361_039,It took two minutes to respond.
p361_040,Why you did it will never be known.
p361_041,He was in his element.
p361_042,That means an extra two years.
p361_043,"So, we have to go back."
p361_044,I'm sure he does.
p361_045,He was found again almost a year later.
p361_046,The answer was wrong.
p361_047,They need to be helped.
p361_048,It is all starting to come together.
p361_049,I am the fastest player on the course.
p361_050,It is the tip of the iceberg.
p361_051,They were taken to prove a point.
p361_052,It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
p361_053,It is an important step forward.
p361_054,A final agreement has not yet been completed.
p361_055,And they removed a Borderer.
p361_056,That is the way it is.
p361_057,That was something else.
p361_058,This resulted in the following.
p361_059,I want to deal with this stuff.
p361_060,We will be patient but we will win.
p361_061,As good as they come.
p361_062,It is not for me to say.
p361_063,For that much we must be grateful.
p361_064,But the law is very clear on this.
p361_065,I thought it was quite a positive result.
p361_066,But we are very near.
p361_067,Nobody else is at risk.
p361_068,We are not going to back off.
p361_069,He said it was for sale.
p361_070,We have a strong team at the moment.
p361_071,This is a dream come true.
p361_072,The problem is not confined to the UK.
p361_073,It is on the news.
p361_074,They said there was nothing.
p361_075,They were looking for things.
p361_076,I've got to be better than that   Quite.
p361_077,I wouldn't give them a grade.
p361_078,As it should be.
p361_079,We have never been short of volunteers.
p361_080,But who is it?
p361_081,Kenny Miller might come through.
p361_082,Workers will now be balloted on the offer.
p361_083,It just isn't there.
p361_084,Drama is not one of them.
p361_085,And we have a singer.
p361_086,It was exactly four months away.
p361_087,This is a personal decision for me.
p361_088,It's just a failing service.
p361_089,We all want to be left alone.
p361_090,"I was saying, No."
p361_091,Where are they?
p361_092,I am delighted to hear this news.
p361_093,I knew him a little.
p361_094,They just have a go.
p361_095,"If it's going in, it goes in."
p361_096,Nobody called me to explain.
p361_097,You didn't get a modified.
p361_098,What kind of person is he?
p361_099,"Seriously, we are not concerned at all."
p361_100,What has changed since then?
p361_101,He knows he is good.
p361_102,I welcome the decision.
p361_103,It could take some time.
p361_104,The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p361_105,It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.
p361_106,I've done a lot in that building.
p361_107,Music is all consuming.
p361_108,The results are very positive.
p361_109,Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p361_110,Which is where we come in.
p361_111,I'm not looking forward to it.
p361_112,"Next league matches, Aberdeen - Dundee United."
p361_113,He is a pro.
p361_114,They have to tell it as it is.
p361_115,This could easily have been another tragedy.
p361_116,You should enjoy the day.
p361_117,He was taken ill in his office.
p361_118,We couldn't get enough of it.
p361_119,"Cost is a factor, but not the only one."
p361_120,I am not very pleased.
p361_121,It is just a statement of fact.
p361_122,It was on my mind a little bit.
p361_123,I will just have to be patient.
p361_124,I didn't think about it again.
p361_125,And if they fail?
p361_126,He has gone through the process before.
p361_127,Social workers are on stand-by to help.
p361_128,We've always had something to do.
p361_129,How do you take them away?
p361_130,It will be released in October.
p361_132,That got me out.
p361_133,IT is called a killing in the trade.
p361_134,It's a matter for the Committee.
p361_135,It will have to ratify the deal.
p361_136,I've never seen anything like it.
p361_137,It was highly successful.
p361_138,We needed someone and we now have him.
p361_139,It has to find out what went wrong.
p361_140,Only one was from Glasgow.
p361_141,I'm sure he will be aware of it.
p361_142,Until you hit the big games.
p361_143,They received no money under the merger.
p361_144,It was a big departure.
p361_145,She has never mentioned it.
p361_146,I want my mum.
p361_147,It seems to have been an own goal.
p361_148,Or someone wants to say something different.
p361_149,There are no second chances.
p361_150,And it was great for me.
p361_151,I am extremely sad.
p361_152,This series is for real.
p361_153,It has still to be recovered.
p361_154,The conclusion is the same.
p361_155,I wish they would commit to us.
p361_156,The driver just insulted me.
p361_157,Something has to be put in place.
p361_158,"Hopefully, he will get a lucky break."
p361_159,It's a mixture of everything.
p361_160,That is the sensible outcome.
p361_161,You can see the appeal of running away.
p361_162,This means a lot of hard decisions.
p361_163,That comes at a cost.
p361_164,And so did the rest of her team.
p361_165,He tells the truth and that's important.
p361_166,Those are difficult decisions.
p361_167,The omens are not good.
p361_168,The game was there to be won.
p361_169,Then there's the casting.
p361_170,There is no signature.
p361_171,We can't go on like this.
p361_172,It is a very demanding course.
p361_173,Can he do it?
p361_174,The quality of life is difficult for them.
p361_175,I've won the British.
p361_176,"If they wish to go, they can go."
p361_177,"However, it was a different story in the final."
p361_178,I was just aghast.
p361_179,They get money for it now.
p361_180,I could have been offended.
p361_181,That's not the way to think.
p361_182,I can see it now.
p361_183,Then everyone must consider their future.
p361_184,There was nothing she could do.
p361_185,We want to be part of it.
p361_186,It was a bit of a shock.
p361_187,It's not long enough.
p361_188,This is positive and welcome.
p361_189,Now he is back on top again.
p361_190,Actors like to be in the centre.
p361_191,Anything less will not do.
p361_192,Failure is not an option.
p361_193,That is clearly not happening fast enough.
p361_194,We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
p361_195,You look at that.
p361_196,They will be very physical.
p361_197,It has been well worth it.
p361_198,It was just a feeling.
p361_199,People are trying to run away.
p361_200,"On the face of it, this is excellent news."
p361_201,This is clearly not abuse.
p361_202,He should be careful.
p361_203,Everyone knew the family.
p361_204,I am prepared to step down.
p361_205,Translation - we got it wrong.
p361_206,"We will be working on that this week, all right."
p361_207,These are serious matters.
p361_208,The pace is telling.
p361_209,She has always been very friendly.
p361_210,Their loss is heartbreaking.
p361_211,It is his script.
p361_212,I am a socialist.
p361_213,The response was really good.
p361_214,The squad is too small.
p361_215,You can blame the defence.
p361_216,Usually the enjoyment is two ways.
p361_217,It just could be a good night.
p361_218,But we were wrong.
p361_219,This has gone on too long.
p361_220,It is an outrage.
p361_221,It is a performance.
p361_222,It is the best place.
p361_223,We tried to get them down.
p361_224,There were other problems for Brown yesterday.
p361_225,I don't know the full story.
p361_226,Part-time staff are being laid off.
p361_227,"Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea."
p361_228,But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p361_229,I just want him to win a tournament.
p361_230,Eight others are also believed to have died.
p361_231,"This time, he will be more on the defensive."
p361_232,I will never see my son again.
p361_233,But it is being pursued.
p361_234,He knew they were there.
p361_235,That would end it for us.
p361_236,We didn't and it cost us the game.
p361_237,It attracted no complaints.
p361_238,Neil is never going to come back.
p361_239,The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
p361_240,Four of the victims were women.
p361_241,He was also very happy to listen.
p361_242,It's to do with this place.
p361_243,It's a technical demand.
p361_244,Sadly it is a mess.
p361_245,That has to take its toll.
p361_246,We want to see the maximum of change.
p361_247,But those days are dead and gone.
p361_248,However we must not be complacent.
p361_249,And that was just the start.
p361_250,Nothing was meant by it.
p361_251,That was my last game.
p361_252,Colour is another problem.
p361_253,It is not just the agencies.
p361_254,It came in bits and pieces.
p361_255,You don't see that.
p361_256,"They seem to be, anyway."
p361_257,I thought they were just excited.
p361_258,He will appear in court today.
p361_259,Or is he?
p361_260,Was he confident about his prospects?
p361_261,What can you do?
p361_262,It's been very difficult.
p361_263,Do something that we need.
p361_264,There is no other offer on the table.
p361_265,"When she returned, it was a wreck."
p361_266,Nobody is pushing out to the right.
p361_267,It is difficult to say.
p361_268,He is not the only one.
p361_269,We call it marriage.
p361_270,Full back was a bit of the unknown.
p361_271,It's not the tour.
p361_272,So what is the secret of the success?
p361_273,My husband was fighting for his life.
p361_274,So was the first half.
p361_275,It is still under discussion with the board.
p361_276,That is one point of view.
p361_277,We are in this for the long haul.
p361_278,Here we go then.
p361_279,No reason was given.
p361_280,I can't wait for it to come out.
p361_281,I am really sorry that he is going.
p361_282,"Indeed, that has already begun."
p361_283,But it's the truth.
p361_284,We have been here before.
p361_285,And he did that.
p361_286,And she is very clear on this.
p361_287,His remarks were disgraceful.
p361_288,I did not think it was very proper.
p361_289,I have really noticed that this week.
p361_290,In a way he was.
p361_291,I will never forget that.
p361_292,It was considered to be topical.
p361_293,"Well, that's all right then."
p361_294,No-one is a winner in this.
p361_295,Who wants to be a millionaire?
p361_296,What do you think?
p361_297,They went back to the seventeenth.
p361_298,"If we don't do it, someone else will."
p361_299,"Again, there was no detail."
p361_300,Let the voters decide.
p361_301,Then it will come.
p361_302,It should be easy.
p361_303,Is it worth it?
p361_304,I will build a house on the site.
p361_305,We are right at the heart of Europe.
p361_306,I do my job.
p361_307,They have to get that sorted.
p361_308,That is a dangerous assumption.
p361_309,Does it make a profit?
p361_310,I think it's a good sign.
p361_311,A winter of discontent awaits.
p361_312,I knew him well.
p361_313,I am not ready to walk away.
p361_314,Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
p361_315,They are already there.
p361_316,I'd never given up on myself.
p361_317,The concerns were unfounded.
p361_318,It doesn't look good for her.
p361_319,It was a management problem in the hospital.
p361_320,I have some comments.
p361_321,You have to be realistic.
p361_322,There was nowhere for him to go.
p361_323,Not that he was complaining.
p361_324,We are very proud of him.
p361_325,"There they were, making excuses for him."
p361_326,It just got out of control.
p361_327,Every case is completely different.
p361_328,It's all about unfinished business.
p361_329,Our own people are coming over on Friday.
p361_330,"In Scotland, there should be vigilance."
p361_331,It will be fine.
p361_332,Yet the job is far from over.
p361_333,He has a point.
p361_334,He should emerge as the winner.
p361_335,It is our other home.
p361_336,"When you think you cannot go on, you can."
p361_337,What a difference a game can make.
p361_338,It is their day.
p361_339,"They are a very good side, without a doubt."
p361_340,They are used to it.
p361_341,And we are doing it.
p361_342,It's just not good enough.
p361_343,I have a cold.
p361_344,You've got to hand it to them.
p361_345,"Next League matches, Aberdeen - Dundee."
p361_346,It was his own decision.
p361_347,This is still happening in the US.
p361_348,And that was the real problem.
p361_349,But then the problems began.
p361_350,"It wasn't about her singing, though."
p361_351,From the opening Could It Be Magic?
p361_352,The duties are still to be drawn up.
p361_353,That there would be discussions.
p361_354,It must not happen.
p361_355,That would be unsafe.
p361_356,I did not go looking anywhere else.
p361_357,We had no idea what was going on.
p361_358,If only it had been.
p361_359,"So far, it is no more."
p361_360,Seven people were critically injured.
p361_361,I am very sorry to be here.
p361_362,He could have given them a lot.
p361_363,It was up to him.
p361_364,It's going to happen.
p361_365,I don't think so.
p361_366,And that was just about that.
p361_367,"By hard work, is the answer."
p361_368,It is really special to me.
p361_369,This is a major step forward.
p361_370,They haven't got the uniform.
p361_371,"Well, you don't have time."
p361_372,It is very funny.
p361_373,I just hope it's not tonight against us.
p361_374,This is good news for the industry.
p361_375,There are no quick fixes.
p361_376,Because they didn't want to know.
p361_377,What do we have to do?
p361_378,I have never seen anything like it.
p361_379,It's about New Yorkers.
p361_380,That was a real challenge.
p361_381,They will give it a couple of years.
p361_382,He certainly would have approved.
p361_383,Conditions were less than ideal.
p361_384,We want this place to work.
p361_385,Father is on the train.
p361_386,It could have been prevented.
p361_387,We have been going for three years.
p361_388,"Firstly, we don't know we can do this."
p361_389,I think it was entirely the right decision.
p361_390,It is planned for London in the spring.
p361_391,Everything is coming together well.
p361_392,They would have to go to the Royal.
p361_393,But we are not afraid of them.
p361_394,It didn't matter who was in their way.
p361_395,That will be the criteria for the future.
p361_396,They thought they couldn't get any.
p361_397,He was too good for me - too consistent.
p361_398,I am delighted to have her back home.
p361_399,This idea is a good starting point.
p361_400,She had denied the charge.
p361_401,It was cynical and callous.
p361_402,It's a dead end.
p361_403,What sort of man is that?
p361_404,The message was clear.
p361_405,We are going nowhere.
p361_406,It is truly masterly performance.
p361_407,She failed to win any of them.
p361_408,It is believed he had been stabbed.
p361_409,Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p361_410,It has a rally instead of a conference.
p361_411,I found that we couldn't.
p361_412,He is very sensitive.
p361_413,That can benefit the larger companies.
p361_414,I am still waiting for a reply.
p361_415,We told them in July.
p361_416,This was a very tragic accident.
p361_417,"We are very, very confident."
p361_418,It is a result we should savour.
p361_419,Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
p361_420,We certainly do not intend to disband.
p361_421,My life is going to go on.
p361_422,It's really part of our mission.
p361_423,That was only the start.
p361_424,But what took them so long?
