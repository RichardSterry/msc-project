p374_001,Please call Stella.
p374_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p374_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p374_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p374_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p374_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p374_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p374_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p374_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p374_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p374_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p374_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p374_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p374_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p374_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p374_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p374_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p374_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p374_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p374_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p374_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p374_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p374_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p374_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p374_025,She had to learn a new discipline.
p374_026,This isn't some form of commission.
p374_027,The game today is certainly different.
p374_028,We did it in one take.
p374_029,I'll take the blame for that.
p374_030,And that was just for starters.
p374_031,"In order to get there, we have got to invest."
p374_032,Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p374_033,I will always remember the horrible images.
p374_034,"What you sow, you have to reap."
p374_035,We are expecting a big crowd.
p374_036,I was contacted this morning.
p374_037,He didn't want me to leave the house.
p374_038,It's not just a challenge for us.
p374_039,"But honestly, there is no need for us to panic."
p374_040,I've had a ball.
p374_041,Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p374_042,YOU thought it was a headache.
p374_043,I still hope to go.
p374_044,Does that put pressure on us?
p374_045,As a player you have to move on.
p374_046,It is so out of character.
p374_047,I am inclined to play it down.
p374_048,"However, it's good to turn the page."
p374_049,His condition was serious but stable.
p374_050,He had reason to be pleased.
p374_051,We have a problem.
p374_052,I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p374_053,That alibi is now gone.
p374_054,But the cost to his health was enormous.
p374_055,I suspect the latter.
p374_056,"However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response."
p374_057,"It is simple, really."
p374_058,The net is closing.
p374_059,I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p374_060,That took a long time to happen.
p374_061,It was on fire.
p374_062,This year the exercise is being repeated.
p374_063,Nobody did in those days.
p374_064,"You, the British people, are the boss."
p374_065,Where is the discipline?
p374_066,We were very much a happy family.
p374_067,They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p374_068,This time it is official.
p374_069,It's going to be epic.
p374_070,She could easily have been killed.
p374_071,"Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed."
p374_072,I didn't mean to kill her.
p374_073,"We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week."
p374_074,That money could have been coming to Scotland.
p374_075,I'd love to do another Olympics.
p374_076,What method of funding is being used?
p374_077,It is not a standing army.
p374_078,This is a great day.
p374_079,He got his degree.
p374_080,I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
p374_081,and their remit is limited.
p374_082,I have great respect for all my players.
p374_083,"They might be broken, but they are not defeated."
p374_084,There is no question of dithering.
p374_085,His track record is not promising.
p374_086,"Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey."
p374_087,It would be very dangerous.
p374_088,Now it has been eclipsed.
p374_089,Our numbers are small.
p374_090,We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p374_091,I am confident of the outcome this week.
p374_092,It's not right of Labour.
p374_093,It doesn't always work that way.
p374_094,This was much worse.
p374_095,"That, though, is not true."
p374_096,I'm working at the moment.
p374_097,"However, this is only the start."
p374_098,They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
p374_099,"He loved it, and so did they."
p374_100,I want to be there by right.
p374_101,That was very important.
p374_102,Two and a half million people have died.
p374_103,I hope they understand that.
p374_104,"Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things."
p374_105,"It's a very, very special day."
p374_106,Let that be their memorial.
p374_107,We're all paying for it.
p374_108,Lester was like that.
p374_109,"Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre."
p374_110,"That is very, very bad news for our nation."
p374_111,We were never told it was already decided.
p374_112,It was a sickening sight.
p374_113,"We are at an advanced stage, and are now instructing counsel."
p374_114,I don't think it would make any difference.
p374_115,They have just got to believe in themselves.
p374_116,"If that is not a warning, what is it?"
p374_117,I fell in love with it.
p374_118,It ignores the future.
p374_119,The quality of work is very impressive.
p374_120,That's not going to happen again.
p374_121,Paterson was the man.
p374_122,The course is in great condition.
p374_123,"Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer."
p374_124,It is too early to speculate.
p374_125,It's up to them.
p374_126,They went to the press.
p374_127,I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p374_128,We are very pleased.
p374_129,You're not going to get hurt.
p374_130,THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p374_131,I was very fortunate.
p374_132,It had been in place since last July.
p374_133,Players want to know what is on offer.
p374_134,They are a good team.
p374_135,The contest was already over.
p374_136,Does it make a profit?
p374_137,"Now, that would impress the kids."
p374_138,It was the only possible decision.
p374_139,How much of a cop out is that?
p374_140,The whole region is in shock.
p374_141,Where is the logic in that?
p374_142,"I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes."
p374_143,I told the players that at half-time.
p374_144,I see the extended family once a year.
p374_145,Why is this?
p374_146,It was indeed a night to remember.
p374_147,Raymond was always on the outside.
p374_148,There is something in this.
p374_149,And so it should.
p374_150,News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p374_151,They may differ on other issues.
p374_152,That's the important thing.
p374_153,But opinion was divided.
p374_154,Next league matches Motherwell.
p374_155,I have been there already.
p374_156,My wife is totally behind me on this.
p374_157,Scott and Emily were so happy.
p374_158,"Sub Not Used, McCulloch."
p374_159,But every two minutes it was exploding.
p374_160,And sooner than we may think.
p374_161,It is a step up.
p374_162,You probably have never seen them before.
p374_163,"However, it is not all bad news for women."
p374_164,We're very proud of him and his achievement.
p374_165,Something has got to change.
p374_166,I made a mistake.
p374_167,I'd never given up on myself.
p374_168,That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
p374_169,That's the kind of production it was.
p374_170,Little girls are his victims.
p374_171,"It is not for me, though."
p374_172,Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p374_173,The rest is his own.
p374_174,The statement was a lie.
p374_175,It is the manager's decision.
p374_176,It was a day for records.
p374_177,The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p374_178,There's no reason for panic.
p374_179,We have got away with it.
p374_180,"However, the referee was not in the giving vein."
p374_181,I was doing well at the hustings.
p374_182,He had planned to sell it.
p374_183,It was just one of those days.
p374_184,But it did not last.
p374_185,She has been unable to work since.
p374_186,No-one has ever seen inside.
p374_187,I know nothing about that.
p374_188,We have not given up.
p374_189,Archer is no newcomer to the stage.
p374_190,It's a matter of time.
p374_191,The number never came.
p374_192,You encourage them - you can do it.
p374_193,The winner will be announced by early summer.
p374_194,This is the New Edinburgh.
p374_195,The stadium was full.
p374_196,There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
p374_197,Perhaps it is jealousy.
p374_198,His name is Michael Owen.
p374_199,"Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round."
p374_200,I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p374_201,This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p374_202,I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p374_203,"Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised."
p374_204,It was so unfair.
p374_205,Smith has not let him down.
p374_206,They have to be dealt with.
p374_207,Glasgow is a friendly city.
p374_208,"No, it's actually in a block of flats."
p374_209,They were that poor.
p374_210,"It was an odd affair, in many respects."
p374_211,Stan is a vital part of our future.
p374_212,We're very close to being a good team.
p374_213,All these things have an impact.
p374_214,I thought their commitment was superb.
p374_215,I'm really proud of my young players.
p374_216,There was great support all round the route.
p374_217,I had nothing to lose.
p374_218,That is just not true.
p374_219,History is made at the Masters.
p374_220,This is not a European Army.
p374_221,"Not so, he insisted."
p374_222,All of the names are familiar to me.
p374_223,I wonder what they listen to?
p374_224,Does a lot of drawing.
p374_225,A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p374_226,"There are moments of honesty, too."
p374_227,He is doing just that.
p374_228,The night is young.
p374_229,That is bad enough.
p374_230,We used to keep our business rates.
p374_231,I suspect that it will.
p374_232,We need to think.
p374_233,We are very happy with the verdict.
p374_234,They want it to work.
p374_235,For once it wasn't about money.
p374_236,"It's not the end of the matter, of course."
p374_237,That doesn't happen in Europe.
p374_238,Jackson may well be right.
p374_239,Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p374_240,"He's very, very lucky to be alive."
p374_241,It's always somebody else's.
p374_242,It could now be up to the courts.
p374_243,We can make a difference.
p374_244,This was not a contest.
p374_245,It is just so sad.
p374_246,"Meanwhile, the business of government goes on."
p374_247,This was not an easy meeting for me.
p374_248,It all depends on the Chancellor.
p374_249,I get very excited by that.
p374_250,The members have clearly spoken.
p374_251,It was not pretty.
p374_252,It was like a scene from the Holocaust.
p374_253,Which means it matters.
p374_254,This is certainly not the case.
p374_255,There is great potential on this river.
p374_256,It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p374_257,Our thoughts are with his family.
p374_258,It is a technique.
p374_259,The court has not decided.
p374_260,I feel sorry for the Reds.
p374_261,I just want to get rid of it.
p374_262,I have not come in to take over.
p374_263,Is this accurate?
p374_264,But what did it matter?
p374_265,"Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected."
p374_266,I am expecting to win.
p374_267,"It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more."
p374_268,I was an athlete.
p374_269,We don't need to change the law.
p374_270,All of us do.
p374_271,"Three months or so later, they are returning."
p374_272,"That is partly true, but there are ways of doing it."
p374_273,We can only do that for so long.
p374_274,He got very close tonight.
p374_275,I don't know why you say goodbye.
p374_276,It is our other home.
p374_277,Where do you start?
p374_278,"At the end of the day, two men have been shot."
p374_279,It was the first time they met.
p374_280,I am also delighted for all the players.
p374_281,We are delighted with that.
p374_282,"He did very well, but didn't win."
p374_283,And we're not there yet.
p374_284,"People don't feel safe, including me."
p374_285,Later we discovered it was a hoax.
p374_286,They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p374_287,It is something that we will put right.
p374_288,I had a good life at Rangers.
p374_289,Perhaps we should do the same.
p374_290,He's very good at relating to adults.
p374_291,It opened last month.
p374_292,Just a year later he was dead.
p374_293,You must be ready to play anyone.
p374_294,This is a club on the rise.
p374_295,I had a sense of deja vu.
p374_296,"That was the theory, anyway."
p374_297,I don't know them or anything.
p374_298,I couldn't make out what was going on.
p374_299,That's what we're trying to achieve.
p374_300,Because we do not need it.
p374_301,The atmosphere is businesslike.
p374_302,They use them for everything.
p374_303,I've already got this.
p374_304,"There's a story, too."
p374_305,There have been different reports from different people.
p374_306,But it has all been worthwhile.
p374_307,But that's another story for another day.
p374_308,It was a foolhardy decision.
p374_309,This is as bad as it can get.
p374_310,"And also, whatever he does, can he really win?"
p374_311,It was just awful.
p374_312,There was a hell of a row.
p374_313,We are satisfied with this outcome.
p374_314,I am not a threat to coaches.
p374_315,It's never over until it's over.
p374_316,He had been a singer.
p374_317,"I was very pleased with them today, though."
p374_318,"If you're going to do it, do it right."
p374_319,We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p374_320,No one was listening.
p374_321,It's not one for the purists.
p374_322,It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p374_323,It really is good to be back.
p374_324,We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p374_325,It will never happen.
p374_326,We cannot go on like this.
p374_327,The biggest thing is structure.
p374_328,This could be a recipe for conflict.
p374_329,This is great news for us.
p374_330,We certainly have to try something.
p374_331,SO now we know the secret.
p374_332,"Harrowing is easy, after all."
p374_333,What is that?
p374_334,We just want them home.
p374_335,And we have beaten them before.
p374_336,He has two children.
p374_337,That is the fact of the matter.
p374_338,It was a matter of choice.
p374_339,And that's good news for the magpies.
p374_340,But we can't have a casino.
p374_341,I'm looking forward to that.
p374_342,So what is their secret?
p374_343,It's a great idea.
p374_344,It was not being marketed properly.
p374_345,I have been struggling with my form.
p374_346,That was about it.
p374_347,It is coming on very well.
p374_348,We won't go down without a struggle.
p374_349,"By hard work, is the answer."
p374_350,We were unlucky not to score.
p374_351,I did not have a bet on myself.
p374_352,As if they ever stopped.
p374_353,And that brings us to the point.
p374_354,Clark is back on top form.
p374_355,"But happily, the story is true."
p374_356,It does seem a mystery.
p374_357,"Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight."
p374_358,It's for that reason he should resign.
p374_359,It's a good start.
p374_360,One person had a broken back.
p374_361,I hope that is the lucky break.
p374_362,It is almost like a family.
p374_363,But when we do it is great.
p374_364,I disagree entirely with the decision.
p374_365,My game is coming back.
p374_366,It was a game they could have won.
p374_367,Then came the collision with Sergio.
p374_368,It is a matter for Westminster.
p374_369,"And we know that, because we know the hairdresser."
p374_370,I can't believe the buzz.
p374_371,Sport is good for you.
p374_372,I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p374_373,This is not a struggle against Islam.
p374_374,This is the goal.
p374_375,The mood was euphoric.
p374_376,I want to get at the truth.
p374_377,Everyone here is very sad.
p374_378,It was located on the remote control.
p374_379,I am not changing my mind.
p374_380,Is something which we just don't do.
p374_381,He was taken ill in his office.
p374_382,"It is, though the law is not clear cut."
p374_383,It's the only thing.
p374_384,Two others were also seriously injured.
p374_385,What's the best thing to do?
p374_386,For tragedy it is.
p374_387,I'm trying to stay open on that.
p374_388,"Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United."
p374_389,It was good today.
p374_390,We are all very pleased.
p374_391,The hotel was huge.
p374_392,These days are over.
p374_393,They do it properly.
p374_394,"Well, you can have a tree."
p374_395,I just don't know what she was doing.
p374_396,"However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland."
p374_397,You can't have both.
p374_398,That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p374_399,I was influenced by all of these things.
p374_400,You do not change overnight.
p374_401,Or so it seemed.
p374_402,I will have to think about it.
p374_403,He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p374_404,"Well, you can't have everything."
p374_405,They have not given them the evidence.
p374_406,We need to chat.
p374_407,We are obviously disturbed by this case.
p374_408,That was never their agenda.
p374_409,I certainly will not settle.
p374_410,He said it was the worst possible result.
p374_411,It's very tragic and traumatic.
p374_412,"It's always the same, isn't it?"
p374_413,I don't make it mystical.
p374_414,So what was he really doing?
p374_415,Neither could be contacted last night.
p374_416,That clearly wasn't what they wanted.
p374_417,Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p374_418,And well he might.
p374_419,They have not been named.
