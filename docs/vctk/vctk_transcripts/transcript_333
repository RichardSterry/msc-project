p333_001,Please call Stella.
p333_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p333_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p333_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p333_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p333_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p333_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p333_008,"These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p333_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p333_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p333_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p333_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p333_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p333_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p333_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p333_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p333_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p333_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p333_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p333_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p333_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p333_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p333_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p333_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p333_025,He needed seven hours of surgery.
p333_026,"In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times."
p333_027,But who shot the president?
p333_028,"Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep."
p333_030,All would be under threat.
p333_031,Some will be deployed on submarines.
p333_032,There are moments of silence.
p333_033,So now this series has had its day.
p333_034,Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p333_035,Bobby Robson called him a genius.

p333_038,Too many factors are now working against him.
p333_039,His views are hardly surprising.
p333_040,It is time for a new approach.
p333_041,We have nothing to say about that.
p333_042,We've tried every other way.
p333_043,"Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland."
p333_044,Nobody else was with me.
p333_045,"However, the report was incorrect."
p333_046,It does make a big difference.
p333_047,Do not forget about Monaco.
p333_048,"Peter, of course, refuses to conform."
p333_049,You can't give in to the vandals.
p333_050,Everything was an effort.
p333_051,And does it even matter?
p333_052,This is the same old story.
p333_053,George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p333_054,My parents are exhausted.
p333_055,"No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted."
p333_056,The performance was excellent.
p333_057,"Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory."
p333_058,"The overall effect is impressive, but distancing."
p333_059,It will come up here.
p333_060,"From our point of view, the player is free to leave."
p333_061,Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p333_062,The chief constable is right.
p333_063,I didn't expect to get one.
p333_064,It has been blown out of all proportion.
p333_065,This is only the start of my season.
p333_066,It sounded awfully like panic.
p333_067,I've taken to the hills.
p333_068,John was a very nice man.
p333_069,"This is a big, big win."
p333_070,The crowd was awesome.
p333_071,Every game against New Zealand is.
p333_072,The jury is still out on this one.
p333_073,My game is in pretty good shape.
p333_074,That would have killed the match.
p333_075,"Still, the experience was amazing, she says."
p333_076,I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p333_077,They had not been handcuffed.
p333_078,I think we will join the single currency.
p333_079,Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p333_080,But the tragedy did not stop there.
p333_081,They wanted to show what they could do.
p333_082,It runs until the beginning of June.
p333_083,All of us do.
p333_084,But will they fall in love?
p333_085,It was different from our other work.
p333_086,That is in the public domain.
p333_087,The Hague is too good for him.
p333_088,"On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options."
p333_089,"In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed."
p333_090,It's a true story.
p333_091,We are looking for volunteers.
p333_092,"John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say."
p333_093,"It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player."
p333_094,"Subs not used, McCulloch."
p333_095,"Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain."
p333_096,He could face a jail sentence.
p333_097,They didn't take you to mass graves.
p333_098,There was no option.
p333_099,"Life is about people, and how you feel about people."
p333_100,Could they perhaps be related?
p333_101,Happily we found it in the library.
p333_102,We all thought we were going to die.
p333_103,Maybe he will act again.
p333_104,Safety was also an issue.
p333_105,That's why he visited.
p333_106,I know a lot of people who don't.
p333_107,There was nobody on the roof.
p333_108,Clark is back on top form.
p333_109,"He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland."
p333_110,It needs somebody to give way.
p333_111,We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p333_112,It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p333_113,I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
p333_114,The days of empty promises are over.
p333_115,I thought he was terrific.
p333_116,Henry was strong and talented.
p333_117,That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p333_118,I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p333_119,We must improve our relations with government.
p333_120,"Within six minutes, they were two goals down."
p333_121,This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p333_122,A venue was found.
p333_123,"Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding."
p333_124,He said it was the worst possible result.
p333_125,"Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive."
p333_126,This is our way to make our point.
p333_127,It was a disaster.
p333_128,"It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain."
p333_129,He was back to square one.
p333_130,Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p333_131,I have been coming here for nine years.
p333_132,It is just part of modern day life.
p333_133,A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p333_134,Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p333_135,Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p333_136,YOU thought it was a headache.
p333_137,All the people thought that he would die.
p333_138,It is never an easy game.
p333_139,This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p333_140,No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
p333_141,The post will run for four years.
p333_142,"However, it's good to turn the page."
p333_143,He had reason to be pleased.
p333_144,It was important to win the singles.
p333_145,That is impressive by any standards.
p333_146,There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p333_147,"I'm thinking, what would be easier?"
p333_148,That alibi is now gone.
p333_149,We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p333_150,The Scots are great.
p333_151,"He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline."
p333_152,"However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response."
p333_153,I will certainly be having words with him.
p333_154,She is a valuable member of the Government.
p333_155,"I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio."
p333_156,Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p333_157,But he is not using them.
p333_158,Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
p333_159,I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p333_160,We are not moving in.
p333_161,It was a breathtaking moment.
p333_162,That's been our position all along.
p333_163,I was in jail for five years.
p333_164,There are no charges.
p333_165,His funeral is not expected until next week.
p333_166,Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p333_167,"I am very, very happy."
p333_168,They got the job done.
p333_169,They tried to give her advice.
p333_170,They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p333_171,"It is true, but it is only part of the issue."
p333_172,It's going to be epic.
p333_173,"Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes."
p333_174,It was large enough to fit the wall.
p333_175,He just carried on filming.
p333_176,He will be judged by his actions.
p333_177,I never found my rhythm.
p333_178,I didn't mean to kill her.
p333_179,It is a job creation scheme.
p333_180,"In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot."
p333_181,We might be back next year.
p333_182,It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p333_183,The same goes for personnel.
p333_184,In a way he was.
p333_185,This area is perfect for children.
p333_186,"No, they have not."
p333_187,The feeling between the two men was mutual.
p333_188,"That was a hard game to play in, very tough."
p333_189,I was chosen to do this.
p333_190,The weekly average was three hours.
p333_191,When he took over it really took off.
p333_192,I have been very nervous.
p333_193,The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p333_194,There was an element of jealousy.
p333_195,There was no happy ending.
p333_196,Craig is still suffering seizures.
p333_197,I didn't play well last year.
p333_198,"Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey."
p333_199,That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p333_200,Now it has been eclipsed.
p333_201,Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p333_202,We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p333_203,"Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair."
p333_204,It is legally binding.
p333_205,It has come as a bombshell.
p333_206,Before the games it was pretty open.
p333_207,We didn't know he was even out.
p333_208,He is only now regaining his confidence.
p333_209,Singing has gone out of fashion.
p333_210,"Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought."
p333_211,They must be kept on the ground.
p333_212,We still don't know.
p333_213,Police have appealed for witnesses.
p333_215,This is a foolish idea.
p333_216,It separates the men from the boys.
p333_217,I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p333_218,Or some thought that they have.
p333_219,If only we had known.
p333_220,This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p333_221,A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
p333_222,You'll get on like a house on fire.
p333_223,Two and a half million people have died.
p333_224,It could not be too high.
p333_225,How many cases have there been?
p333_226,I hope they understand that.
p333_227,"Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things."
p333_228,But Annika is just amazing.
p333_229,Our job is to change that.
p333_230,She will also get a pay rise.
p333_231,It's because they can't understand the language.
p333_232,It is time for a more honest approach.
p333_233,"That is very, very bad news for our nation."
p333_234,"Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start."
p333_235,What's it all about?
p333_236,It is a big time for me.
p333_237,There were two things going on at once.
p333_238,It's something we want to make work.
p333_239,I want to play at the highest level.
p333_240,We are all equal.
p333_241,That is the key message.
p333_242,It ignores the future.
p333_243,This is the subway.
p333_244,Altman has every right to be bitter.
p333_245,It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p333_246,We were hopeful that it would be successful.
p333_247,Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p333_248,"It is a weakness, and not the only one."
p333_249,He's in with the furniture.
p333_250,There are two games to go after that.
p333_251,"However, the appeal judges rejected the argument."
p333_252,Who will provide the wine?
p333_253,We are still getting signals.
p333_254,"What's it got to do with them, anyway?"
p333_255,But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p333_256,We started from scratch.
p333_257,Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p333_258,There are a few changes.
p333_259,You're not going to get hurt.
p333_260,THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p333_261,The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p333_262,THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p333_263,I heard some of his remarks.
p333_264,Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p333_265,It has to be funded.
p333_266,Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p333_267,I was just overwhelmed.
p333_268,It had been in place since last July.
p333_269,It was very frightened and dirty.
p333_270,Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p333_271,"I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me."
p333_272,That's a very strong element.
p333_273,How much of a cop out is that?
p333_274,The whole region is in shock.
p333_275,It was a journey into a new life.
p333_276,It's a way of making a mark.
p333_277,Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p333_278,You were the kidnappers.
p333_279,It is a very interesting subject.
p333_280,We know we can't rely on you.
p333_281,"Arguably, they have already done it."
p333_282,It was indeed a night to remember.
p333_283,It doesn't appear to be anything too serious.
p333_284,There is something in this.
p333_285,I could feel the blood on my face.
p333_286,That's why he plays for Scotland.
p333_287,There are no plans to change this.
p333_288,It's too big a risk to take.
p333_289,It's going to be quite a challenge.
p333_290,I have heard the stories from Scotland.
p333_291,It is just too long since the war.
p333_292,My wife is totally behind me on this.
p333_293,Debbie Harry was cool.
p333_294,Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p333_295,"We are the British National Party, not the English National Party."
p333_296,That sort of thing is long gone.
p333_297,And sooner than we may think.
p333_298,Raised the way you want it.
p333_299,"However, consumers may take a different view."
p333_300,I know you went back this morning.
p333_301,I will carry on.
p333_302,A review of the decision is being sought.
p333_303,I made a mistake.
p333_304,It is a very special city.
p333_305,A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p333_306,They certainly do not socialise.
p333_307,It's my favourite place to hang out.
p333_308,I think that could work to our advantage.
p333_309,Was that not awful?
p333_310,That was him under pressure.
p333_311,Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p333_312,He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p333_313,I'm not blaming audiences.
p333_315,The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p333_316,"Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry."
p333_317,"I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue."
p333_318,"However, the referee was not in the giving vein."
p333_319,I was doing well at the hustings.
p333_320,We will just get on with it.
p333_321,We are worried about casualties.
p333_322,This is my music.
p333_323,I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p333_324,I haven't won the world title.
p333_325,"After his birthday, Scott was very upset."
p333_326,It's fantastic to have finally won.
p333_327,But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p333_328,And now he tells us.
p333_329,I am not changing my event.
p333_330,Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p333_331,This Patton will also return.
p333_332,That is as it may be.
p333_333,"They did, too, but it didn't matter by then."
p333_334,He came in an army uniform.
p333_335,Eleven events are required.
p333_336,It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p333_337,You encourage them - you can do it.
p333_338,The winner will be announced by early summer.
p333_339,I always said No.
p333_340,The stadium was full.
p333_341,Cinema is a communal experience.
p333_342,"So, how will it be received in the US?"
p333_343,He was different from the rest of us.
p333_344,His name is Michael Owen.
p333_345,He's got a great chance of making it.
p333_346,Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
p333_347,"For now, we must take one game at a time."
p333_348,So now you know.
p333_349,"But, at the same time, they made you think about life."
p333_350,I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p333_351,I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p333_352,The feeling is awesome.
p333_353,"By social devices, the two groups are coming together."
p333_354,Smith has not let him down.
p333_355,We have obviously got some work to do.
p333_356,Which he can do.
p333_357,"No, it's actually in a block of flats."
p333_358,It has been recorded twice.
p333_359,They were that poor.
p333_360,And we're talking Big Money.
p333_361,His silence on the issue is interesting.
p333_362,They have two children.
p333_363,"With Pierre, you can never be sure."
p333_364,Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p333_365,I'm really proud of my young players.
p333_366,People buy everything with cash.
p333_367,There was a great support all round the route.
p333_368,They should feel ashamed.
p333_369,I felt we had fallen back a little.
p333_370,Both managements are very supportive.
p333_371,"In addition, it was in breach of natural justice."
p333_372,I'll go out and be aggressive.
p333_373,This is important for two reasons.
p333_374,I'm just looking to take my chances.
p333_375,Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p333_376,You will not feel a thing.
p333_377,"It's been like that for ages, according to the guys."
p333_378,It's not just for classical music.
p333_379,This must be kept in total perspective.
p333_380,All of the names are familiar to me.
p333_381,"There are moments of honesty, too."
p333_382,"Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault."
p333_383,Is that where we are?
p333_384,We used to keep our business rates.
p333_385,"It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult."
p333_386,But there's no eye contact.
p333_387,There was no energy behind it.
p333_388,"They could take the result away from them, couldn't they."
p333_389,Have we not had the rainy season already?
p333_390,We have chosen for the patients.
p333_391,They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
p333_392,It is not a wish list.
p333_393,He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p333_394,"If not, he should go home."
p333_395,There is no margin for error.
p333_396,"Meanwhile, the business of government goes on."
p333_397,I get very excited by that.
p333_398,"Anyway, she is playing a lesbian."
p333_399,"In the end, it will mean an awful lot."
p333_400,Which means it matters.
p333_401,I think it can count against you now.
p333_402,There is a great potential on this river.
p333_403,"This is a one-year deal, but who knows?"
p333_404,She said he showed no remorse.
p333_405,They hold on for many years.
p333_406,"After New Labour, we now have New Unionists."
p333_407,"However, there are signs of dissent among his collies."
p333_408,There's nothing for you here.
p333_409,Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p333_410,Officials say the city must achieve this.
p333_411,"It may mean more money, but we don't need the money."
