p273_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p273_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p273_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p273_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p273_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p273_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p273_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, and its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p273_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p273_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p273_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p273_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p273_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p273_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p273_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p273_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p273_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p273_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p273_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p273_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p273_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p273_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p273_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p273_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p273_025,"A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
"
p273_026,"It was as if I had been stabbed.
"
p273_027,"Because we do not need it.
"
p273_028,"It is about control of our economy.
"
p273_029,"Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
"
p273_030,"It is a tough game but we have a chance.
"
p273_031,"I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
"
p273_032,"It carries a double message.
"
p273_033,"That is the face of fear.
"
p273_034,"The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
"
p273_035,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p273_036,"This will save interest charges.
"
p273_037,"Every aspect of our play was first class.
"
p273_038,"He looks like an Afghan.
"

"
p273_041,"Her body was found about four miles from the car.
"
p273_042,"I was inspired by two things.

p273_043,"Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
"
p273_044,"My fitness was very poor.
"
p273_045,"We have to look beyond the very short term.
"
p273_046,"The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.
"
p273_047,"I expect a rapid response.
"
p273_048,"I must take a seat.
"
p273_049,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p273_050,"How are you, sir ?
"
p273_051,"So is that it, then ?
"
p273_052,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p273_053,"What do we do ?
"
p273_054,"The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
"
p273_055,"Let's hope that it does.
"
p273_056,"We have to keep our clients.
"
p273_057,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p273_058,"We will pay their bills.

"
p273_061,"I was conceived in Aberdeen.
"
p273_062,"Robin Williams is very subdued.
"
p273_063,"The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.

"
p273_072,"After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.

p273_085,"The allegations were still under investigation, he added.

p273_086,"I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
"
p273_087,"He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
"
p273_088,"It was clear on Thursday.
"
p273_089,"It was a family tragedy.
"
p273_090,"It's not a holiday time for football players.

"
p273_092,"He was prepared for this.
"
p273_093,"Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
"
p273_094,"We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
"
p273_095,"We intend to change the model.
"
p273_096,"We should recognise that others have done a good job.
"
p273_097,"But the battle has only just begun.
"
p273_098,"The following are the principal provisions.
"
p273_099,"Before the game we went for a pint.

"
p273_105,"The pressure is on them.
"
p273_106,"New Year will be very busy.
"
p273_107,"There's still plenty of time left.

p273_111,"Then again, we could have.
"
p273_112,"Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
"
p273_113,"Here, again, they were denied a voice.
"
p273_114,"We would make a start.
"
p273_115,"His job was not advertised.
"
p273_116,"This is a frightening development.
"
p273_117,"Which can happen any time.
"
p273_118,"That is far too high.
"
p273_119,"My life has changed a lot.
"
p273_120,"Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
"
p273_121,"That would open the gates of hell.
"
p273_122,"You are a gambling man.
"
p273_123,"It feels like a privilege.
"
p273_124,"That is the ultimate revenge.
"
p273_125,"I am totally devoted to this job.
"
p273_126,"We'll have to think about it.
"
p273_127,"I love the spectacle of cinema.

p273_134,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p273_135,"Behind him was his brother.
"
p273_136,"She had gone to the Catholic school.
"
p273_137,"One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
"
p273_138,"It would seem a natural progression.
"
p273_139,"It was a terrible combination of factors.
"
p273_140,"Today is not a victory.
"
p273_141,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p273_142,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p273_143,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p273_144,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p273_145,"And does it ?
"
p273_146,"Are you from the rugby ?
"
p273_147,"Had I heard ?
"
p273_148,"This action reflects a slump in bookings.
"
p273_149,"They should stop the bombing.
"
p273_150,"The Internet is no substitute for customer service.

"
p273_154,"Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
"
p273_155,"They could not match it.
"
p273_156,"I always felt they played for me.
"
p273_157,"His team management was protective.
"
p273_158,"One season, they might do well.
"
p273_159,"The jury is still out.
"
p273_160,"Phase one was a shambles.
"
p273_161,"I did not have a bet on myself.
"
p273_162,"It is also very valuable.
"
p273_163,"For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
"
p273_164,"They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
"
p273_165,"Says the Duke of York.

p273_177,"Everyone can have their opinion.
"
p273_178,"Because he was born in England.
"
p273_179,"I came home by ambulance.
"
p273_180,"What happened in that game ?
"
p273_181,"Are you going to win ?
"
p273_182,"Was it the wife ?
"
p273_183,"Why change it ?
"
p273_184,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p273_185,"We've had an enjoyable adventure.
"
p273_186,"It comes from reflection or thinking.
"
p273_187,"It was a moment of madness.
"

"
p273_197,"It was worth a photograph.

"
p273_203,"It had all been arranged.
"
p273_204,"The statement contained no surprises.
"
p273_205,"His third goal was superb.
"
p273_206,"It will affect their work.
"
p273_207,"I am considered a teenager.
"
p273_208,"IT S all change at Kilmarnock.

"
p273_222,"The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
"
p273_223,"They would have to go to the Royal.
"
p273_224,"But he failed to win the committee's support.
"
p273_225,"He is obviously very dangerous.
"
p273_226,"It depends on Labour, not on us.
