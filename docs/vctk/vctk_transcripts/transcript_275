p275_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p275_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p275_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p275_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p275_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p275_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p275_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p275_009,"There is , according to the legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p275_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p275_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p275_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways. 
"
p275_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p275_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p275_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p275_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p275_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p275_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p275_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p275_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p275_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p275_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p275_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p275_025,"But it failed.
"
p275_026,"Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
"
p275_027,"We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
"
p275_028,"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
"
p275_029,"Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
"
p275_030,"They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
"
p275_031,"There's a story, too.
"
p275_032,"He was jailed for four years.
"
p275_033,"We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
"
p275_034,"Then, suddenly, they weren't.
"
p275_035,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p275_036,"However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
"
p275_037,"They're just different.
"
p275_038,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p275_039,"Indeed, he does.
"
p275_040,"Sadly, it can't.
"
p275_041,"Dancing was her life.
"
p275_042,"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
"
p275_043,"We will push.
"
p275_044,"The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
"
p275_045,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p275_046,"Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
"
p275_047,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p275_048,"Every aspect of our play was first class.
"
p275_049,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p275_050,"Here's a clue.
"
p275_051,"I had come back from London.
"
p275_052,"Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
"
p275_053,"It is unique.
"
p275_054,"That's the truth.
"
p275_055,"There's a danger.
"
p275_056,"We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
"
p275_057,"The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
"
p275_058,"George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
"
p275_059,"This is the first step.
"
p275_060,"It's good news and long overdue.
"
p275_061,"And if he hadn't become a musician?
"
p275_062,"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
"
p275_063,"I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
"
p275_064,"Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
"
p275_065,"Try to save us.
"
p275_066,"He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
"
p275_067,"Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
"
p275_068,"Strathclyde police had appealed for witnesses.
"
p275_069,"He was at home with his pals.
"
p275_070,"It's all I can do.
"
p275_071,"There could be a way back.
"
p275_072,"I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
"
p275_073,"It works for us.
"
p275_074,"The party is up for it.
"
p275_075,"The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
"
p275_076,"Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
"
p275_077,"I will miss him.
"
p275_078,"A review is under way.
"
p275_079,"He had suffered a heart attack.
"
p275_080,"He is driven.
"
p275_081,"He seems to be pleased with the picture.
"
p275_082,"Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
"
p275_083,"They lived for their children.
"
p275_084,"The city council is a major property owner in the area.
"
p275_085,"Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
"
p275_086,"It is a lifeline.
"
p275_087,"They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
"
p275_088,"This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
"
p275_089,"I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
"
p275_090,"But I was wrong.
"
p275_091,"I saw the whole thing.
"
p275_092,"Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
"
p275_093,"Hartley should know.
"
p275_094,"It is a love affair.
"
p275_095,"May not have been at fault?
"
p275_096,"Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
"
p275_097,"We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
"
p275_098,"There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
"
p275_099,"Oil embargo endorsed.
"
p275_100,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p275_101,"He takes the job.
"
p275_102,"She reflects a bit.
"
p275_103,"Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped him form.
"
p275_104,"Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
"
p275_105,"It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
"
p275_106,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p275_108,"He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
"
p275_109,"It's a shame.
"
p275_110,"It was the eighties.
"
p275_111,"It is a financial matter.
"
p275_112,"It is so sad.
"
p275_113,"Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
"
p275_114,"The mood is upbeat.
"
p275_115,"In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
"
p275_116,"It's not fair.
"
p275_117,"We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
"
p275_118,"It is rubbish.
"
p275_119,"Who would be a referee?
"
p275_120,"That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
"
p275_121,"There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
"
p275_122,"Who would have?
"
p275_123,"That's all right then.
"
p275_124,"I wouldn't have wanted any other way.
"
p275_125,"It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
"
p275_126,"She really suffered for her art.
"
p275_127,"It is not a U-turn.
"
p275_128,"Offered the gold medal, he declined.
"
p275_129,"Who will attend?
"
p275_130,"Twaddle is a case in point.
"
p275_131,"The BBC was a disgrace.
"
p275_132,"I am now unemployed.
"
p275_133,"She said she would not welcome the flowers.
"
p275_134,"It plans to return to this field.
"
p275_135,"What will happen then?
"
p275_136,"It's not true.
"
p275_137,"Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
"
p275_138,"Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
"
p275_139,"It was very frightened and dirty.
"
p275_140,"We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
"
p275_141,"Is that it?
"
p275_142,"If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
"
p275_143,"It seems so long since I did the exams.
"
p275_144,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p275_145,"Who would be right?
"
p275_146,"No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
"
p275_147,"He realises his mistake.
"
p275_148,"Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
"
p275_149,"I was awful.
"
p275_150,"We have the location, which is assured.
"
p275_151,"He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
"
p275_152,"Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
"
p275_153,"I am just trying to do my job.
"
p275_154,"So I got a blood test.
"
p275_155,"It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
"
p275_156,"But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
"
p275_157,"The weather forecast isn't good.
"
p275_158,"It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
"
p275_159,"They have not been named.
"
p275_160,"We also enjoyed a lot of support.
"
p275_161,"It was by the numbers.
"
p275_162,"She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
"
p275_163,"For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
"
p275_164,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p275_165,"Well, he should know.
"
p275_166,"Was this element always there?
"
p275_167,"These days are long gone.
"
p275_168,"I was in the train station overnight.
"
p275_169,"We've all had the shots.
"
p275_170,"Tell it like it was?
"
p275_171,"Seven people were later detained by police.
"
p275_172,"Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
"
p275_173,"You had to go and see him.
"
p275_174,"In a way he was.
"
p275_175,"One season, they might do well.
"
p275_176,"Is Saddam a threat?
"
p275_177,"As we worked.
"
p275_178,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p275_179,"It is not either national standards or local control.
"
p275_180,"He deserved the win.
"
p275_181,"In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
"
p275_182,"Tony had arrived.
"
p275_183,"The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
"
p275_184,"Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
"
p275_185,"His name was unknown.
"
p275_186,"It's an idea.
"
p275_187,"Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
"
p275_188,"Four policemen were wounded.
"
p275_189,"I saw military vehicles in the distance.
"
p275_190,"What has caused the demise of singing?
"
p275_191,"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
"
p275_192,"It is a farce.
"
p275_193,"Peace was won.
"
p275_194,"It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
"
p275_195,"Yet the data is compelling.
"
p275_196,"I came home by ambulance.
"
p275_197,"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
"
p275_198,"I have a cold.
"
p275_199,"On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
"
p275_200,"Tommy is not a problem.
"
p275_201,"Who will pay for this?
"
p275_203,"But she might be.
"
p275_205,"Some realism was needed about the time, resources and management.
"
p275_207,"I don't want to use it.
"
p275_208,"Feel the heat?
"
p275_209,"He knows a lot.
"
p275_210,"You have a plan?
"
p275_211,"We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
"
p275_212,"It had all been arranged.
"
p275_213,"So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
"
p275_214,"IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
"
p275_215,"He seemed to lose his focus.
"
p275_216,"Work has started.
"
p275_217,"The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
"
p275_218,"The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
"
p275_219,"He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
"
p275_220,"Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
"
p275_221,"During the communist time they were very privileged.
"
p275_222,"We could easily be cut again.
"
p275_223,"Saturday is gone.
"
p275_224,"It's the Tate.
"
p275_225,"Clearly, the stakes are high.
"
p275_226,"I will win.
"
p275_227,"The report is due out next month.
"
p275_228,"I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
"
p275_229,"He is in the queue.
"
p275_230,"My wife and family are the support system.
"
p275_231,"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
"
p275_233,"The parties have been given until today to respond.
"
p275_234,"Of course I was tempted.
"
p275_235,"We will treat it like a World Cup match.
"
p275_236,"It would still have been a good film, but very different.
"
p275_237,"The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
"
p275_238,"He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
"
p275_239,"In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
"
p275_240,"It is hard won.
"
p275_241,"Our policy is clear.
"
p275_242,"It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
"
p275_243,"I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
"
p275_244,"I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
"
p275_246,"Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
"
p275_247,"It was a hit.
"
p275_248,"The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
"
p275_249,"I can't get a job.
"
p275_250,"For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
"
p275_251,"Kirkwood was arrested.
"
p275_252,"Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
"
p275_253,"It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
"
p275_254,"One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
"
p275_255,"Is that a serious question?
"
p275_256,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p275_257,"This court has made an order which has not been observed.
"
p275_258,"Souter will be back.
"
p275_259,"Blood samples were taken.
"
p275_260,"They want to shut the Scottish Office.
"
p275_261,"It will be done in stages.
"
p275_262,"This is a question of Islam.
"
p275_263,"That review will look at the management across the sector as a whole.
"
p275_264,"Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
"
p275_265,"It's very nice.
"
p275_266,"It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
"
p275_268,"She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
"
p275_269,"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
"
p275_270,"It was very fast.
"
p275_271,"In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
"
p275_272,"His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
"
p275_273,"In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
"
p275_274,"It's so awful.
"
p275_275,"It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
"
p275_276,"We are a grandmother.
"
p275_277,"He looked very sharp.
"
p275_278,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p275_279,"Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
"
p275_280,"This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
"
p275_281,"You've got to have both sides.
"
p275_282,"It was a virus.
"
p275_283,"Yet, it worked.
"
p275_284,"The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
"
p275_285,"It was good.
"
p275_286,"Who did the recruiting?
"
p275_287,"Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
"
p275_288,"Bombing slaughter rejected
"
p275_289,"We are not going to forget.
"
p275_290,"I could never be cool.
"
p275_291,"Who can predict?
"
p275_292,"There was a vacuum.
"
p275_293,"I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
"
p275_294,"That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
"
p275_295,"The tournament has now been cancelled.
"
p275_296,"She is really magic.
"
p275_297,"One was a lawyer.
"
p275_298,"A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
"
p275_299,"There were no passengers on board.
"
p275_300,"It could work.
"
p275_301,"This is a war over our home.
"
p275_302,"In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
"
p275_303,"The court had a number of empty seats.
"
p275_304,"The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
"
p275_305,"The plot is minimal.
"
p275_306,"They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
"
p275_307,"There's no evidence he was ever there.
"
p275_308,"You should be.
"
p275_309,"The minister is the engineer.
"
p275_310,"The letters are going out today.
"
p275_311,"I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
"
p275_312,"We have got no money to go anywhere.
"
p275_313,"The Premier League has been a huge success.
"
p275_314,"We have got to get the points from this one.
"
p275_315,"My whole life has changed.
"
p275_316,"The election is total confusion and chaos.
"
p275_317,"Kids are terrible.
"
p275_320,"We are in the end game.
"
p275_321,"Our message was inclusive.
"
p275_322,"Off with their heads.
"
p275_323,"The figures are bad, but not that bad.
"
p275_324,"My view has now completely changed.
"
p275_325,"Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
"
p275_326,"Is that an issue?
"
p275_327,"Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
"
p275_328,"Finally, he paid for the movie.
"
p275_329,"You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
"
p275_330,"It's been hard.
"
p275_331,"Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
"
p275_332,"Who will do it?
"
p275_333,"I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
"
p275_334,"That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
"
p275_335,"He also insisted that no concession had been made to the French.
"
p275_336,"In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
"
p275_337,"We are the gateway to justice.
"
p275_338,"In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
"
p275_339,"Yet, for the money, he was not the man of the match.
"
p275_340,"This is a friendly match?
"
p275_341,"I got a yellow card.
"
p275_342,"The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
"
p275_343,"Tell us about it.
"
p275_344,"There may be reasons for it.
"
p275_345,"I believe the gap is nearly there.
"
p275_346,"He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
"
p275_347,"Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
"
p275_348,"A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
"
p275_349,"She is free.
"
p275_350,"Both of those promises have already been honoured.
"
p275_351,"Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
"
p275_352,"The pair are very much in love.
"
p275_353,"It is not like us.
"
p275_354,"Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
"
p275_355,"To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
"
p275_356,"We will be homeless.
"
p275_357,"That would help.
"
p275_358,"It is a memorial.
"
p275_359,"This is a club on the rise.
"
p275_360,"All the investment is possible through the public sector.
"
