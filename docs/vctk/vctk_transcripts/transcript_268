p268_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p268_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p268_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p268_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p268_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p268_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p268_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p268_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p268_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p268_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p268_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p268_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p268_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p268_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p268_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p268_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p268_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p268_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p268_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p268_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p268_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p268_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p268_025,"They might have asked, for goodness sake.
"
p268_026,"He got very close tonight.
"
p268_027,"Smoking is also very important.
"
p268_028,"Wages and salaries account for a major proportion of our expenses.
"
p268_029,"The first appeared to be successful.
"
p268_030,"We must convince the citizens.
"
p268_031,"Carlton also declined to comment last night.
"
p268_032,"She is employed on short-term contracts.
"
p268_033,"Further management changes are planned.
"
p268_034,"Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.

"
p268_036,"We are opening an inquiry.
"
p268_037,"He works at the airport.
"
p268_038,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p268_039,"How are you, sir ?
"
p268_040,"So is that it, then ?
"
p268_041,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p268_042,"What do we do ?
"
p268_043,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p268_044,"However, the purchase is as yet unproven.
"
p268_045,"Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
"
p268_046,"Something has to give sometime.
"
p268_047,"Her husband had been waiting for her return.
"
p268_048,"You must always attempt to raise the bar.

"
p268_055,"I knew my contract was up this year.
"
p268_056,"The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
"
p268_057,"But it couldn't happen overnight.
"
p268_058,"It was just too much for us.
"
p268_059,"Perhaps we should do the same.
"
p268_060,"They desperately want some stability.
"
p268_061,"Everything is possible in football.
"
p268_062,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p268_063,"This trend is likely to strengthen.
"
p268_064,"Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
"
p268_065,"He will need that machine.
"
p268_066,"Debate was impassioned and furious.
"
p268_067,"I would not say that.

p268_070,"The regional newspapers have outperformed the national titles.
"
p268_071,"A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
"
p268_072,"We deserved the three points.
"
p268_073,"The wingers must have felt the cold.
"
p268_074,"I am relishing the challenge.
"
p268_075,"Let's hope that it does.
"
p268_076,"But the organisers refused to worry.
"
p268_077,"We have to keep our clients.
"
p268_078,"We should be able to cope.
"
p268_079,"He also had a Scottish grandfather.
"
p268_080,"Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
"
p268_081,"George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
"
p268_082,"But I had never been in a theatre.
"
p268_083,"He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
"
p268_084,"Kenny Miller might come through.
"
p268_085,"Scottish football is finally on its way back.

p268_087,"We will pay their bills.

"
p268_095,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p268_096,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p268_097,"And does it ?
"
p268_098,"Are you from the rugby ?
"
p268_099,"Had I heard ?
"
p268_100,"What happened in that game ?
"
p268_101,"Are you going to win ?
"
p268_102,"You should try to have a laugh.
"
p268_103,"There can be no compromise on welfare.

p268_144,"He was forced to quit.
"
p268_145,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p268_146,"Does the name matter ?
"
p268_147,"how do you get it back ?
"
p268_148,"I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
"
p268_149,"Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
"
p268_150,"I was given no instructions by no-one.
"
p268_151,"The move follows a review of the Singapore

p268_152,"We're not taking any risks.

"
p268_202,"It is all to do with the coaching.

p268_203,"There was a fine line to tread.
"
p268_204,"The refund is fully justified.
"
p268_205,"McCarthy said it would look at other means of tackling market abuse.
"
p268_206,"We believe a third party was involved.
"
p268_207,"I love the spectacle of cinema.

"
p268_215,"The whole thing was just unreal.
"
p268_216,"The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
"
p268_217,"However, this concern appears to be misguided.
"
p268_218,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p268_219,"We had to add value.
"
p268_220,"Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
"
p268_221,"My players have no idea about football.
"
p268_222,"Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
"

p268_228,"There's always the next century.
"
p268_229,"For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.

p268_237,"And they removed a Borderer.
"
p268_238,"Does that put pressure on us ?
"
p268_239,"Did it work ?

p268_240,"Do you think we are a top nation ?
"
p268_241,"It would seem a natural progression.
"
p268_242,"Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
"
p268_243,"We will turn the corner.

"
p268_275,"They made such decisions in London.
"
p268_276,"Clearly, they had other problems.
"
p268_277,"First, the programme was unbalanced.
"
p268_278,"The happiness was slightly misplaced.
"
p268_279,"Phase one was a shambles.
"
p268_280,"If that's the case, he will struggle.
"
p268_282,"A winter of discontent awaits.
"
p268_283,"But no party would win overall control of Scotland.
"
p268_284,"Injuries have taken their toll.

"
p268_289,"What are they for ?
"
p268_290,"Is there a waiting list ?
"
p268_291,"When she went off it was quite amazing.
"

"
p268_307,"I saw them last week.
"
p268_308,"Friday night was a pretty good night.
"
p268_309,"This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
"
p268_310,"You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
"
p268_311,"In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
"
p268_312,"Everyone can have their opinion.
"
p268_313,"I was inspired by two things.

"
p268_322,"The result is utterly compelling.
"
p268_323,"The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.

p268_347,"After the match, do you ?
"
p268_348,"Have I really come to this ?
