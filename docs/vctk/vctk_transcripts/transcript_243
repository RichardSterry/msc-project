p243_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p243_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p243_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p243_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p243_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p243_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p243_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p243_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p243_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p243_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p243_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p243_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p243_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p243_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p243_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p243_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p243_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p243_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p243_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p243_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p243_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p243_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p243_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p243_025,"He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
"
p243_026,"His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
"
p243_027,"I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
"
p243_028,"The west coast line is not just for middle England.
"
p243_029,"The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
"
p243_030,"She brought a lot to my life.
"
p243_031,"Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
"
p243_032,"Thomson and his family left court without comment.
"
p243_033,"I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
"
p243_034,"But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
"
p243_035,"It is about control of our economy.
"
p243_036,"Each brand was owned by a different family.
"
p243_037,"That was not perfect golf by any means.
"
p243_038,"He added that her comments were noted.
"
p243_039,"She will get through it I'm sure.
"
p243_040,"Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
"
p243_041,"Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
"
p243_042,"He does not even trust his own members.
"
p243_043,"He too started on the subs seats.
"
p243_044,"Is it worth it ?
"
p243_045,"Does it matter ?
"
p243_046,"How do you take them away ?
"
p243_047,"However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
"
p243_048,"After the match, do you ?
"
p243_049,"Has the conflict started ?
"
p243_050,"Have I really come to this ?
"
p243_051,"I'm as fit as I can get.
"
p243_052,"We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
"
p243_053,"He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
"
p243_054,"The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
"
p243_055,"Andy was a huge influence yet again.
"
p243_056,"They seem too much of a sure thing.
"
p243_057,"Her husband had been waiting for her return.
"
p243_058,"You must always attempt to raise the bar.
"
p243_059,"We just want this season to end.
"
p243_060,"It was a day she thought she would never see.
"
p243_061,"Talks have continued at many different levels.
"
p243_062,"The referee is there to decide these things.
"
p243_063,"There were no details of the other five victims.
"
p243_064,"It also has a good labour supply.
"
p243_065,"Indeed he has a lot of output.
"
p243_066,"Do not give your details to anyone.
"
p243_067,"He was failed by his health authority.
"
p243_068,"But it was not all bad news.
"
p243_069,"I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
"
p243_070,"But during the bid process, that changed completely.
"
p243_071,"It turned me against the whole system.
"
p243_072,"She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
"
p243_073,"I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
"
p243_074,"But two groups refused to sign up.
"
p243_075,"I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
"
p243_076,"It had little effect on European equity markets.
"
p243_077,"I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
"
p243_078,"The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
"
p243_079,"The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
"
p243_080,"They said our costs were too high.
"
p243_081,"I do not attempt to answer that.
"
p243_082,"It's been a great evening for us.
"
p243_083,"That kind of growth is the important thing.
"
p243_084,"A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
"
p243_085,"No plan for projects are yet in place.
"
p243_086,"Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
"
p243_087,"I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
"
p243_088,"Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
"
p243_089,"I feel I did not have enough time.
"
p243_090,"Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
"
p243_091,"I can't remember a lot about the accident.
"
p243_092,"Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
"
p243_093,"They had the appeal of TV stars.
"
p243_094,"There is no issue of national security involved here.
"
p243_095,"He will be a very hard act to follow.
"
p243_096,"Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
"
p243_097,"Put simply, it goes something like this.
"
p243_098,"Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
"
p243_099,"Even if he doesn't have any lines.
"
p243_100,"I am delighted to hear this news.
"
p243_101,"We are already seeing some positive results.
"
p243_102,"We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
"
p243_103,"We were under a bit of pressure.
"
p243_104,"They won't actually make any money from it.
"
p243_105,"I bought a flat six years ago.
"
p243_106,"They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
"
p243_107,"They are a different team at home.
"
p243_108,"It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
"
p243_109,"Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
"
p243_110,"Some young girls also came by last night.
"
p243_111,"Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
"
p243_112,"What are they for ?
"
p243_113,"Is there a waiting list ?
"
p243_114,"Do they think anyone else wants them ?
"
p243_115,"So what happens next ?
"
p243_116,"Had this been common practice ?
"
p243_117,"What do they want us to do ?
"
p243_118,"The idea is the shop within a shop.
"
p243_119,"I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
"
p243_120,"It is the right package for Scotland.
"
p243_121,"They have no real friends in the region.
"
p243_122,"England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
"
p243_123,"Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
"
p243_125,"I think there's not much between them.
"
p243_126,"So I am going in the right direction.
"
p243_127,"Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
"
p243_128,"We have to offer value for money.
"
p243_129,"It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
"
p243_130,"I could live without the attention, he admitted.
"
p243_131,"He's got to look after himself now.
"
p243_132,"He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
"
p243_133,"No country has a similar training programme.
"
p243_134,"There is no future in rock music.
"
p243_135,"Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
"
p243_136,"Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
"
p243_137,"The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
"
p243_138,"We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
"
p243_139,"The programme has been made with great care.
"
p243_140,"There was only one living room, you see.
"
p243_141,"I am not under any new pressure.
"
p243_142,"The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
"
p243_143,"It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
"
p243_144,"They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
"
p243_145,"All eight victims were based in Germany.
"
p243_146,"Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
"
p243_147,"You should feel involved in their lives.
"
p243_148,"It is open season on the Old Firm.
"
p243_149,"Is it in the right place ?
"
p243_150,"Did he trip ?
"
p243_151,"Does that put pressure on us ?
"
p243_152,"Did it work ?
"
p243_153,"Do you think we are a top nation ?
"
p243_154,"Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
"
p243_155,"Time may already have run out for this option.
"
p243_156,"No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
"
p243_157,"When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
"
p243_158,"They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
"
p243_159,"As our national coach, Brown is done for.
"
p243_160,"A progress report will be published in October.
"
p243_161,"This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
"
p243_162,"That will reduce my chance of selection.
"
p243_163,"When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
"
p243_164,"Surely it can't run for two years.
"
p243_165,"But the game is still wide open.
"
p243_166,"It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
"
p243_167,"However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
"
p243_168,"I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
"
p243_169,"We had to work very hard for our points.
"
p243_170,"That is a big risk at any price.
"
p243_171,"You need a long-term strategy in football.
"
p243_172,"He said some things which were better left alone.
"
p243_173,"If successful, several records will be made.
"
p243_174,"The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
"
p243_175,"It didn't come as any great surprise.
"
p243_176,"Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
"
p243_177,"It's just a different way of life.
"
p243_178,"Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
"
p243_179,"Nato has left them with no other option.
"
p243_180,"I am secure in my own position.
"
p243_181,"Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
"
p243_182,"She is believed to be in South Africa.
"
p243_183,"The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
"
p243_184,"We have come a long way since then.
"
p243_185,"I made my mind up before we came on tour.
"
p243_186,"A great player has to win major championships.
"
p243_187,"Highland health board has a responsibility here.
"
p243_188,"I didn't miss the big house at all.
"
p243_189,"The story was not made public by this club.
"
p243_190,"That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
"
p243_191,"You are not long home from work.
"
p243_192,"I am fighting the force of nature.
"
p243_193,"It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
"
p243_194,"Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
"
p243_195,"And they were being paid ?
"
p243_196,"was everything done to save people ?
"
p243_197,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p243_198,"But they had to be paid for.
"
p243_199,"There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
"
p243_200,"The police insisted that they were standard issue.
"
p243_201,"One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
"
p243_202,"I've never had a year like this.
"
p243_203,"Full details are expected to be released in June.
"
p243_204,"As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
"
p243_205,"Hague will be leader at the election after next.
"
p243_206,"He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
"
p243_207,"I want an answer from the British Government.
"
p243_208,"Gas production was also at record levels last year.
"
p243_209,"They are a victim of their own success.
"
p243_210,"We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
"
p243_211,"This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
"
p243_212,"It is going to change the world.
"
p243_213,"Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
"
p243_214,"People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
"
p243_215,"The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
"
p243_216,"I am not going to judge them.
"
p243_217,"I do not see this so much as failure.
"
p243_218,"A European final must be the millennium target.
"
p243_219,"Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
"
p243_220,"I was independent but I am not now.
"
p243_221,"We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
"
p243_222,"We are still seeking that complete performance.
"
p243_223,"My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
"
p243_224,"Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
"
p243_225,"The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
"
p243_226,"If not, a deal could take many months.
"
p243_227,"This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
"
p243_228,"Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
"
p243_229,"I want to see as much progress as possible.
"
p243_230,"This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
"
p243_231,"I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
"
p243_232,"The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
"
p243_233,"They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
"
p243_234,"The labour side has developed in the North area.
"
p243_235,"You are not allowed to do that.
"
p243_236,"That is the last thing they need.
"
p243_237,"He has worked for several years in the United States.
"
p243_238,"The children were later able to leave by bus.
"
p243_239,"Jim was down there with his wife.
"
p243_240,"Was it the wife ?
"
p243_241,"Why change it ?
"
p243_242,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p243_243,"Does the name matter ?
"
p243_244,"how do you get it back ?
"
p243_245,"What are you not good at ?
"
p243_246,"I think, therefore I am ?
"
p243_247,"Church leaders warned other homes could close.
"
p243_248,"The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
"
p243_249,"My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
"
p243_250,"He has many offers from the English Premiership.
"
p243_251,"However, the figures tell a different story.
"
p243_252,"The rise has come too late for some.
"
p243_253,"Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
"
p243_254,"I'd rather play well next week than here.
"
p243_255,"Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
"
p243_256,"The British Government should follow the Irish example.
"
p243_257,"Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
"
p243_258,"Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
"
p243_259,"Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
"
p243_260,"And they never show the same film as a rival.
"
p243_261,"Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
"
p243_262,"There would be a north and south division.
"
p243_263,"The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
"
p243_264,"The two companies were not for sale.
"
p243_265,"His condition was described as serious last night.
"
p243_266,"The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
"
p243_267,"The board do not own the company.
"
p243_268,"Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
"
p243_269,"They always want to give a performance.
"
p243_270,"Its primary business channel is the internet.
"
p243_271,"That's been the difference between the sides.
"
p243_272,"The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
"
p243_273,"I think I was about four years old.
"
p243_274,"Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
"
p243_275,"It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
"
p243_276,"Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
"
p243_277,"I think the shares are good value.
"
p243_278,"One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
"
p243_279,"Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
"
p243_280,"The life office will now stay with Abbey.
"
p243_281,"Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
"
p243_282,"Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
"
p243_283,"He may be ready for first team action in March.
"
p243_284,"The fans pay for their season tickets.
"
p243_286,"In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
"
p243_287,"Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
"
p243_288,"No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
"
p243_289,"We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
"
p243_290,"He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
"
p243_291,"He would get into any world team.
"
p243_292,"Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
"
p243_293,"They first met during a Step in London.
"
p243_294,"The agreement remains the only show in town.
"
p243_295,"The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
"
p243_296,"The strong performance is expected to continue.
"
p243_297,"Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
"
p243_298,"It is based on population rather than need.
"
p243_299,"He could understand both points of view.
"
p243_300,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p243_301,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p243_302,"And does it ?
"
p243_303,"Are you from the rugby ?
"
p243_304,"Had I heard ?
"
p243_305,"What happened in that game ?
"
p243_306,"Are you going to win ?
"
p243_308,"Further heavy charges are expected this year.
"
p243_309,"It happened on average once a week this year.
"
p243_310,"This is the version which appeared in our paper.
"
p243_311,"He is keen to stay in public service.
"
p243_312,"Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
"
p243_313,"For that reason cover should not be given.
"
p243_314,"He felt too close to head office.
"
p243_315,"If you believe in the blue and white.
"
p243_316,"A report on their property is due within days.
"
p243_317,"He will just go on doing his job.
"
p243_318,"I always felt they played for me.
"
p243_319,"That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
"
p243_320,"The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
"
p243_321,"This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
"
p243_322,"We will not simply hit these people.
"
p243_323,"We still think this trade is on the increase.
"
p243_324,"It is not either national standards or local control.
"
p243_325,"His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
"
p243_326,"I feel as if I can hole everything now.
"
p243_327,"I try to be open to experience.
"
p243_328,"He is not exactly a pretty child.
"
p243_329,"I thought the race was a little bit slow.
"
p243_330,"If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
"
p243_331,"Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
"
p243_332,"I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
"
p243_333,"These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
"
p243_334,"One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
"
p243_335,"Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
"
p243_336,"I hope numbers will be up on last time.
"
p243_337,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p243_338,"How are you, sir ?
"
p243_339,"So is that it, then ?
"
