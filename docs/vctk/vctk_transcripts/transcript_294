p294_001,Please call Stella.
p294_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p294_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p294_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p294_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p294_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p294_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p294_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p294_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p294_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p294_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p294_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p294_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p294_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p294_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p294_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p294_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p294_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p294_019,"Since then physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p294_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p294_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p294_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p294_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p294_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p294_025,They were the better team on the night.
p294_026,"The show is sold out, like the others in the run."
p294_027,It means we have to have some patience.
p294_028,"For the moment, our position remains the same."
p294_029,I was pregnant and very worried.
p294_030,He said she was mad.
p294_031,They were impressive against France.
p294_032,I am delighted at Murray's appointment.
p294_033,The airport was even different.
p294_034,Other people had looked at it.
p294_035,A neighbour said the street was shocked.
p294_036,"Michael, he is running!"
p294_037,"He was taken to hospital, but later died."
p294_038,Their ambition is to go back.
p294_039,He got the same story.
p294_040,My view has now changed completely.
p294_041,I've been dying for an hour.
p294_042,It wasn't a flight of fancy.
p294_043,We're playing away from home and that's it.
p294_044,I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p294_045,They tend to be female and retired.
p294_046,Who was the mystery MP?
p294_047,This was no accident.
p294_048,I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
p294_049,We've all done it!
p294_050,"In fact, it is deeply unpleasant."
p294_051,"Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side."
p294_052,The course record was in his name.
p294_053,But we welcome this document.
p294_054,What is the point of jailing him?
p294_055,We should not bring him into a dispute.
p294_056,This is a possible way forward.
p294_057,I am not here to get even.
p294_058,Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
p294_059,We are only human.
p294_060,I went with the mood.
p294_061,I think we'll just keep it.
p294_062,Debate is not just talk.
p294_063,How is he enjoying life as a senior?
p294_064,It is all about having physical evidence.
p294_065,People remember the Tories in office.
p294_066,What kind of inclusion is that?
p294_067,I fell in love with it right away.
p294_068,Domestic abuse is related to power and control.
p294_069,It makes for an interesting conference.
p294_070,I don't have any answer for them.
p294_071,It took about five or six hours.
p294_072,I found the course inspiring.
p294_073,Two things were clear from the new programme.
p294_074,This is the real thing now.
p294_075,Until they came to do it.
p294_076,She now lives in London.
p294_077,It will not be a long campaign.
p294_078,"Subs not used, McGraw."
p294_079,Three bystanders were killed.
p294_080,One policeman was killed.
p294_081,They could not have done more for me.
p294_082,It was like a vacuum.
p294_083,That was enough for the committee.
p294_084,It is a very genuine prospect.
p294_085,It is the tip of the iceberg.
p294_086,We have to focus on what is important.
p294_087,They have to work so hard.
p294_088,"It's not very pretty, but it's effective."
p294_089,Seven British members of the club are missing.
p294_090,He had just returned from a run.
p294_091,There's a strong involvement.
p294_092,"Now, though, he has an incentive."
p294_093,But now it's back to golf.
p294_094,It should be a condition of employment.
p294_095,Was it a signal?
p294_096,It may not even be possible.
p294_097,"In fact, they go hand in hand."
p294_098,"I gave him a way out, and he took it."
p294_099,"So is that it, then?"
p294_100,You should have let it write the cards.
p294_101,It's annoying in a way.
p294_102,It's too close to call.
p294_103,It's a long process.
p294_104,I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
p294_105,Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p294_106,The other conditions were not specified.
p294_107,I've never felt affection for Emu.
p294_108,That's not part of the deal.
p294_109,That was the context of his remarks.
p294_110,This has gone on too long.
p294_111,We have great confidence in Derek.
p294_112,My ambition is to tell a good story.
p294_113,I don't know the nature of the illness.
p294_114,The industry will try to get round it.
p294_115,Who will deliver more service to Scotland?
p294_116,I want to make a vigorous defence.
p294_117,And she got it.
p294_118,We are the weakest link.
p294_119,We have now no choice.
p294_120,My father and mother are.
p294_121,We don't know what happened after.
p294_122,Did he just want to be on telly?
p294_123,He seems to be used to the attention.
p294_124,It's an hour of the same response.
p294_125,We have very real concerns about it.
p294_126,He has gone through the process before.
p294_127,People will see this over time.
p294_128,I can't speak for him.
p294_129,They were married in Edinburgh last summer.
p294_130,The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
p294_131,I can't see him reversing that.
p294_132,I'm deeply sorry they did.
p294_133,I can lead by example.
p294_134,I have had a wonderful career.
p294_135,It seemed to have direction.
p294_136,This takes the pressure off.
p294_137,It was different in the endurance events.
p294_138,"Above all, the approach is upbeat."
p294_139,The objective was achieved.
p294_140,It was a hugely popular decision.
p294_141,He invented the language.
p294_142,Where are they?
p294_143,It's hard not to.
p294_144,It is a question of life and death.
p294_145,"However, there are no plans for injecting rooms."
p294_146,You ask the question.
p294_147,She was always a quality act.
p294_148,We are all very proud of her.
p294_149,I'm sure that is not.
p294_150,It's a great idea.
p294_151,It's like a score in some ways.
p294_152,It's a wonderful piece of water.
p294_153,"Feel the air, the space."
p294_154,Therein lies the problem.
p294_155,You feel the pride.
p294_156,We are well insured.
p294_157,I was quietly confident about getting the win.
p294_158,The Treasury denied the claims.
p294_159,You've been working for four years.
p294_160,I am the Son of Sam.
p294_161,There is no shortage of commitment.
p294_162,Such as it is.
p294_163,He deserves a second chance.
p294_164,He also admitted.
p294_165,There was no change in the strategy.
p294_166,There's been a mistake.
p294_167,It had until tomorrow to comply.
p294_168,Genetic assessment is crucial.
p294_169,I enjoy my work.
p294_170,We have managed to get it under control.
p294_171,We have a genuine budget in place.
p294_172,Art is still a risky investment.
p294_173,It was little else.
p294_174,These things can happen.
p294_175,Family members are at her bedside.
p294_176,You have to go to the edges.
p294_177,I'm looking forward to facing the Irishmen.
p294_178,Harry will be up for it.
p294_179,He could tell you.
p294_180,My place is in the kitchen.
p294_181,"He was, indeed, a thoroughly decent man."
p294_182,A decision is expected in September.
p294_183,It was a big departure.
p294_184,"That's the name of the game, though."
p294_185,It's a huge amount.
p294_186,The fire was falling from the sky.
p294_187,I want my mum.
p294_188,This is simply unjust.
p294_189,The First Minister is an addict.
p294_190,Its role is not to interfere.
p294_191,It is becoming a bit of a habit.
p294_192,You can't believe a word.
p294_193,Something happened on that island.
p294_194,You can't get a mortgage.
p294_195,It is misleading to compare the two.
p294_196,I want a career.
p294_197,He said nothing to waiting journalists.
p294_198,O Leary was clearly disgusted.
p294_199,That's been the case for a while.
p294_200,"When it is ready, it will be signed."
p294_201,All options are on the table.
p294_202,It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p294_203,We now have a moment of hope.
p294_204,They should not be blamed for it.
p294_205,Our traditions and cultures remain the same.
p294_206,The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p294_207,It will take some time to establish.
p294_208,This club is perfect for me.
p294_209,"And do you know, it just wasn't the same."
p294_210,This came as no great surprise to anyone.
p294_211,I love this job.
p294_212,I have no secrets.
p294_213,"We are very, very pleased with the response."
p294_214,"He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth."
p294_215,They will form a tribute.
p294_216,"We're very, very excited."
p294_217,It's not a question of talking.
p294_218,He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p294_219,Then they killed another three.
p294_220,"We are not a retailer, we provide a service."
p294_221,The six others were injured.
p294_222,She has so much to offer.
p294_223,They are not the answer to staff shortages.
p294_224,It should be a pretty exciting session.
p294_225,Gas is too expensive.
p294_226,Advice and counselling will be offered.
p294_227,Are we going mainstream?
p294_228,I could not believe what they were saying.
p294_229,The protest will go ahead as planned.
p294_230,Who will run the bigger show?
p294_231,"General, You didn't get a modified."
p294_232,I'm not a little girl.
p294_233,"We have seen the future, and it is different."
p294_234,Who does he think will win?
p294_235,We're talking about one or two years.
p294_236,I just have to accept that.
p294_237,He was overwhelmed by the response.
p294_238,They will do nothing for the local people.
p294_239,Do it for us now.
p294_240,We got the guarantee.
p294_241,I couldn't have asked for better.
p294_242,"That is however, the only part of the story."
p294_243,"But happily, the story is true."
p294_244,They are not suitable.
p294_245,Some days are different from others.
p294_247,Everything else is the same.
p294_248,They never gave up hope.
p294_249,But it was a pleasure.
p294_250,There are no excuses left for us.
p294_251,Mental health is a massive issue.
p294_252,His director of football is leaving.
p294_253,We don't want to be too intrusive.
p294_254,Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
p294_255,There are still some matters to be discussed.
p294_256,This would give Scotland around eight members.
p294_257,"I get on him, he gets on me."
p294_258,They are in care for a reason.
p294_259,A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p294_260,I haven't a clue.
p294_261,It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
p294_262,I thought he was terrific.
p294_263,A statement is expected in April.
p294_264,It possibly depends on the position.
p294_265,This will have no effect on the championship.
p294_266,We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
p294_267,I would love to travel with it.
p294_268,Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p294_269,It is a common condition in children.
p294_270,We will work through the night.
p294_271,"I also thought, This is a feature film."
p294_272,"For now, they have gone as far as they can."
p294_273,Boy is the town a mess.
p294_274,It's as simple as that.
p294_275,We've been here before.
p294_276,Neither of them was badly hurt.
p294_277,"From there, it was a success story."
p294_278,It is a very disturbing picture for men.
p294_279,"I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans."
p294_280,It was one in the afternoon.
p294_281,I've never seen them down here.
p294_282,"For some, it might not make too much difference."
p294_283,This is our unfinished business.
p294_284,This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
p294_285,He had asked if they had the script.
p294_286,"It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention."
p294_287,This could take a few days.
p294_288,A great deal was achieved.
p294_289,So it was sad.
p294_290,It's a blunt instrument anyway.
p294_291,There did not need to be a miracle.
p294_292,This could also affect the sentencing.
p294_293,That case has still not been settled.
p294_294,"What do they do, anyway?"
p294_295,They've got a mountain to climb.
p294_296,It just would not work.
p294_297,The acting left a lot to be desired.
p294_298,Who will provide the wine?
p294_299,We started from scratch.
p294_300,There was no happiness.
p294_301,Their bid was a very good one.
p294_302,Everything is so commercial.
p294_303,And this tournament will travel.
p294_304,Could it have been better spent?
p294_305,"If that is the case, it is a breakthrough."
p294_306,The order went out.
p294_307,Cinema is a communal experience.
p294_308,The appeal is impartial.
p294_309,You could see he was thinking about it.
p294_310,"He added, We are full of anger."
p294_311,They have nowhere else to go.
p294_312,"However, it seems that he got it wrong."
p294_313,We work for the athlete.
p294_314,It is three years at present.
p294_315,The document is a starting point for discussion.
p294_316,We all make mistakes.
p294_317,It didn't put me off.
p294_318,Now they have found out the truth.
p294_319,It is an impressive record.
p294_320,Johnson was pretty low.
p294_321,We know we have done wrong.
p294_322,She was married with one son.
p294_323,I wanted to drop out.
p294_324,I told you so.
p294_325,"He's a good player, but he's not the only one."
p294_326,Which is where the manager comes in.
p294_327,Is that what people we want?
p294_328,There are so many unanswered questions.
p294_329,Then it was into a series of classes.
p294_330,He wants to play in the Champions League.
p294_331,I'm so happy that she did.
p294_332,The need for further investment is obvious.
p294_333,Iraq has no interest in war.
p294_334,"It's hard, but we have had so much to do."
p294_335,But it took a lot of bottle.
p294_336,Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
p294_337,That period was a struggle.
p294_338,No-one else was hurt.
p294_339,What's it for?
p294_340,Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
p294_341,Anything can happen - at any moment.
p294_342,She is an imposing presence.
p294_343,There are moments of joy in politics.
p294_344,Is a drug dealer?
p294_345,Where are you taking her?
p294_346,"Yesterday, he was busy in his office."
p294_347,It's just not our biggest problem.
p294_348,The result could be all down to turnout.
p294_349,I'm not going to change from it.
p294_350,There were no violations.
p294_351,That was the type of man he was.
p294_352,They are not falling now.
p294_353,They had to explain it.
p294_354,We didn't mean to kill him.
p294_355,The support of Britain is assumed.
p294_356,So far he has not done so.
p294_357,He completely loses control.
p294_358,No decision on that was taken.
p294_359,My fitness was very poor.
p294_360,The trial continues today.
p294_361,People come to see the Highlands.
p294_362,Europe is a bonus.
p294_363,It is also used to buy coffins.
p294_364,I've got to provide for my family.
p294_365,Such debate is pointless.
p294_366,And it had two seats.
p294_367,Cooking is intricate and complex.
p294_368,He found it very hard to understand.
p294_369,But it would change the context.
p294_370,But who was driving it?
p294_371,We recorded it at our own expense.
p294_372,But opponents were quick to criticise.
p294_373,Try to save us.
p294_374,"We also have had to work the dark side, if you will."
p294_375,We need to increase the membership.
p294_376,Social workers are on stand-by to help.
p294_377,"Certainly, there is much on the agenda."
p294_378,There could be a way back.
p294_379,He edited the press release.
p294_380,Visitors were also impressed.
p294_381,"It was very, very difficult for me to look at this."
p294_382,"Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help."
p294_383,Are there muscular problems?
p294_384,We had our chances.
p294_385,"However, many questions remained unanswered."
p294_386,"I told her, and she was extremely grateful."
p294_387,He is in the queue.
p294_388,But what is?
p294_389,"It wasn't about her singing, though."
p294_390,We have other options.
p294_391,Calvin was back at his best today.
p294_392,My mind was made up.
p294_393,"Nine days later, he suffered another attack."
p294_394,And rugby fans can help.
p294_395,The council's concern is very simple.
p294_396,We are on the path of change.
p294_397,"Rangers didn't turn up, by the way."
p294_398,No other vehicle was involved in the accident.
p294_399,"It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete."
p294_400,"Of course, it doesn't all come off."
p294_401,"In fact, he should never have been in the field."
p294_402,He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
p294_403,We will deal with the refugees.
p294_404,The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
p294_405,It's a tragedy for the area.
p294_406,It was very well received.
p294_407,I don't think there's going to be one.
p294_408,If you could find it.
p294_409,Such is the ego involved.
p294_410,Mr Wilson has received no such request.
p294_411,It raises the edge.
p294_412,It was not known to myself.
p294_413,It is a delight on every level.
p294_414,Would it really be good to shorten it?
p294_415,I don't entirely buy that.
p294_416,"England could not take anything for granted, however."
p294_417,I saw it in a different way.
p294_418,"Or, rather, it isn't."
p294_419,We have every respect for Michelle.
p294_420,Mr Blunkett was convinced.
p294_421,The auction will be held tomorrow.
