p250_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p250_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p250_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p250_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p250_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p250_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p250_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p250_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p250_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p250_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p250_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p250_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p250_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p250_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p250_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p250_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p250_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p250_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p250_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p250_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p250_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p250_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p250_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p250_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p250_025,"A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
"
p250_026,"Meetings will also remain private.
"
p250_027,"I am pretty careful with money.
"
p250_028,"Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
"
p250_030,"This is a central issue.
"
p250_031,"We will not tolerate it.
"
p250_032,"Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
"
p250_033,"He works at the airport.
"
p250_034,"Smoking is also very important.
"
p250_035,"Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
"
p250_036,"It was just appalling luck.
"
p250_037,"Rugby has an extended run.
"
p250_038,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p250_039,"Costs have got to be controlled.
"
p250_040,"You must always attempt to raise the bar.
"
p250_042,"No meaningful response was issued.
"
p250_043,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p250_044,"I made a terrible start.
"
p250_045,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p250_046,"How are you, sir ?
"
p250_047,"So is that it, then ?
"
p250_048,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p250_049,"It comes from reflection or thinking.
"
p250_050,"Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
"
p250_051,"Strikers like to go to the ground.
"
p250_052,"Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
"
p250_053,"Pulled a huge number of viewers.
"
p250_054,"I had trouble with the producers.
"
p250_055,"The teacher would have approved.
"
p250_056,"The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
"
p250_057,"I expect a rapid response.
"
p250_058,"She said she was really sorry.
"
p250_059,"The problems are a result of that shortfall.
"
p250_060,"There's still plenty time left.
"
p250_061,"Let's hope that it does.
"
p250_062,"We have to keep our clients.
"
p250_063,"The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
"
p250_064,"Companies are now seeking to recover their losses.
"
p250_065,"This is the first step.
"
p250_066,"We will pay their bills.
"
p250_067,"We are talking about the outskirts of London.
"
p250_068,"The Farmer wants a new campaign.
"
p250_069,"Only water is currently allowed.
"
p250_070,"I am about protecting the state pension.
"
p250_071,"He later became a respected High Court judge.
"
p250_072,"Robin Williams is very subdued.
"
p250_073,"It wasn't possible to relax.
"
p250_074,"We need to increase the membership.
"
p250_075,"There's nothing they can get on me.
"
p250_076,"I was as strong as a horse.
"
p250_077,"He was a lovely man.
"
p250_078,"Both sides have been hit by injury.
"
p250_079,"We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
"
p250_080,"After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
"
p250_081,"It makes for an interesting conference.
"
p250_082,"I've had it for the exams.
"
p250_083,"This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
"
p250_084,"The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
"
p250_085,"They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
"
p250_086,"He put some colour into Scottish history.
"
p250_087,"They lived for their children.
"
p250_088,"Potions said he would drive.
"
p250_089,"I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence.
"
p250_090,"William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.
"
p250_091,"We are progressing with a few interested parties.
"
p250_092,"That view is held by many others within the industry.
"
p250_093,"The excitement could hardly be contained.
"
p250_094,"The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
"
p250_095,"It is high time to act.
"
p250_096,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p250_097,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p250_098,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p250_099,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p250_100,"And does it ?
"
p250_101,"Are you from the rugby ?
"
p250_102,"Had I heard ?
"
p250_103,"It is an old family habit.
"
p250_104,"The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
"
p250_105,"He was released after treatment.
"
p250_106,"We have made no final decisions.
"
p250_107,"The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
"
p250_108,"We knew they could do it.
"
p250_109,"The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
"
p250_110,"They must be on commission.
"
p250_111,"He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
"
p250_113,"Mr Wilson has received no such request.
"
p250_114,"Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
"
p250_115,"It's good to have a voice.
"
p250_116,"He was prepared for this.
"
p250_117,"However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
"
p250_118,"The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
"
p250_119,"No, the equipment is extra.
"
p250_120,"It didn't come as any great surprise.
"
p250_121,"Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
"
p250_123,"It has been a nightmare of frustration.
"
p250_124,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p250_125,"I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
"
p250_126,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p250_127,"I understand the medical concerns.
"
p250_128,"That's not an assumption that I had made.
"
p250_129,"I have learned from him.
"
p250_130,"The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
"
p250_131,"He thought she was amazing.
"
p250_132,"Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
"
p250_133,"This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
"
p250_134,"It isn't a happy memory.
"
p250_135,"We have a team to reach the final.
"
p250_136,"Failure is not an option.
"
p250_137,"She's got to say something.
"
p250_138,"He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
"
p250_139,"This is a frightening development.
"
p250_140,"It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
"
p250_141,"That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
"
p250_142,"That is far too high.
"
p250_143,"My life has changed a lot.
"
p250_144,"We did what we had to do.
"
p250_146,"You've got to be vigilant.
"
p250_147,"You are a gambling man.
"
p250_148,"I had decided to quit the show.
"
p250_149,"Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
"
p250_150,"It was finally agreed on Saturday.
"
p250_151,"I love the spectacle of cinema.
"
p250_152,"We will try to find someone.
"
p250_153,"She died at her home.
"
p250_154,"What happened in that game ?
"
p250_155,"Are you going to win ?
"
p250_156,"Was it the wife ?
"
p250_157,"Why change it ?
"
p250_158,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p250_159,"Frankly, it was worth the booking.
"
p250_160,"He was pleased with his display.
"
p250_161,"Life is still very tough for them.
"
p250_162,"It is not just about pay.
"
p250_163,"It opens the door to the Champions League.
"
p250_164,"Anyway, the job will be part-time.
"
p250_165,"It has become a way of life.
"
p250_166,"The whole industry is a shambles.
"
p250_167,"People were actually not on his side.
"
p250_168,"The defender made an impressive debut.
"
p250_169,"There's only one team in Ayrshire.
"
p250_170,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p250_171,"They have not been named.
"
p250_172,"The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
"
p250_173,"Yesterday Abbey National said it had injected further capital into Scottish Provident.
"
p250_174,"The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
"
p250_175,"He was asked to quit.
"
p250_176,"This action reflects a slump in bookings.
"
p250_177,"Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
"
p250_178,"I'd love to be like Peter.
"
p250_179,"You will be very welcome.
"
p250_180,"It had so much to do with output.
"
p250_181,"That would open the gates of hell.
"
p250_182,"Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
"
p250_183,"The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
"
p250_184,"They could not match it.
"
p250_185,"First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
"
p250_186,"But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
"
p250_187,"This championship is different from the other majors.
"
p250_188,"I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
"
p250_189,"It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
"
p250_190,"The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
"
p250_191,"Our fans have been marvellous.
"
p250_192,"This could be an amazing attraction for Glasgow.
"
p250_193,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p250_194,"Miller was every bit as happy.
"
p250_195,"They were seriously after him.
"
p250_196,"It was a bit like having children.
"
p250_197,"Aberdeen had little to offer.
"
p250_198,"We represent a wide range of society.
"
p250_199,"He was rejected because he had retired.
"
p250_200,"We always felt we could win.
"
p250_201,"It may have been a cry for help.
"
p250_202,"This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
"
p250_204,"We are going through difficult times.
"
p250_205,"We've had an enjoyable adventure.
"
p250_206,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p250_207,"You could feel the heat.
"
p250_208,"We have to be happy with a British and European record.
"
p250_209,"It was a moment of madness.
"
p250_210,"And we have the experience.
"
p250_211,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p250_212,"It gave no further details.
"
p250_214,"I won't make an official complaint.
"
p250_215,"British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
"
p250_216,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p250_217,"The move follows a review of the Singapore
"
p250_218,"It carried a double message.
"
p250_219,"Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
"
p250_220,"This gives a financial incentive to switch.
"
p250_221,"That might help a bit.
"
p250_222,"Does the name matter ?
"
p250_223,"how do you get it back ?
"
p250_224,"What are you not good at ?
"
p250_225,"I think, therefore I am ?
"
p250_226,"Who was she ?
"
p250_227,"Harry Potter has lost his magic.
"
p250_228,"Today we must not repeat that mistake.
"
p250_229,"It had all been arranged.
"
p250_230,"My daughter is an adult.
"
p250_231,"His third goal was superb.
"
p250_232,"It will affect their work.
"
p250_233,"Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
"
p250_234,"I am considered a teenager.
"
p250_235,"The process will start tomorrow.
"
p250_236,"It's just a normal life.
"
p250_237,"The transaction is not feasible.
"
p250_238,"I wouldn't even respond to that question.
"
p250_239,"It is good for our team.
"
p250_240,"Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
"
p250_241,"That you can do it.
"
p250_242,"It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
"
p250_243,"A career as a doctor is on hold.
"
p250_244,"During the communist time they were very privileged.
"
p250_245,"They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
"
p250_246,"His background is firmly in venture capital.
"
p250_247,"The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
"
p250_248,"I have spoken to the skipper.
"
p250_249,"A small number of new jobs will also be created.
"
p250_250,"She will attend in July.
"
p250_251,"They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
"
p250_252,"The most important thing is the game.
"
p250_253,"There is no timetable for completing such inquiries.
"
p250_254,"Paterson can afford to be generous.
"
p250_255,"The right decision has been made.
"
p250_257,"Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
"
p250_258,"Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
"
p250_260,"Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
"
p250_261,"He was good, but not that good.
"
p250_262,"At half-time he was presented to both teams.
"
p250_263,"He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
"
p250_264,"He is a reporter for us.
"
p250_265,"We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
"
p250_266,"Either way, the investor retains the premium.
"
p250_267,"We've had several problems over injuries.
"
p250_268,"That was a disgraceful performance.
"
p250_269,"Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
"
p250_270,"It was a kind of contempt.
"
p250_271,"Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
"
p250_272,"I should think so, too.
"
p250_273,"There will be widespread support on all sides.
"
p250_274,"Messages have to be reinforced.
"
p250_275,"I got a yellow card.
"
p250_276,"This is no reflection on Rangers.
"
p250_277,"We accept the new rules.
"
p250_278,"They are interior designers and architects.
"
p250_280,"I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
"
p250_281,"Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
"
p250_282,"We are aiming for early March.
"
p250_283,"I felt about this big.
"
p250_284,"And they were being paid ?
"
p250_285,"was everything done to save people ?
"
p250_286,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p250_287,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p250_288,"Is it in the right place ?
"
p250_289,"It is also very valuable.
"
p250_290,"I feel really confident in that department.
"
p250_291,"This could put pressure on UK inflation.
"
p250_292,"Companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price.
"
p250_293,"The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
"
p250_294,"I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
"
p250_295,"We shall rely on human beings.
"
p250_296,"It has the potential to be another North Sea.
"
p250_297,"We would have no control over the threshold for repayment.
"
p250_298,"He has not created a Festival resource.
"
p250_299,"Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
"
p250_300,"I understand the security issue.
"
p250_301,"Frankly, we should all have such problems.
"
p250_302,"It was an easy decision to come here.
"
p250_304,"He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
"
p250_305,"Funding would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland.
"
p250_306,"No-one wanted to run it tonight.
"
p250_308,"We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
"
p250_309,"She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
"
p250_310,"You have to expect this type of thing.
"
p250_311,"Stephen will get his first cap.
"
p250_312,"However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
"
p250_313,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p250_314,"The circumstances have changed since last year.
"
p250_315,"It's all designed to speed up the service.
"
p250_316,"I wanted to change the formula.
"
p250_317,"He will address the nation this evening.
"
p250_318,"I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
"
p250_319,"Motherwell have no such good fortune.
"
p250_320,"We would hope to make progress on that next year.
"
p250_321,"Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
"
p250_322,"The effect was almost magical.
"
p250_323,"And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
"
p250_324,"Holland won by five wickets.
"
p250_325,"There's still no-one like him.
"
p250_326,"McNaughton was not so sure.
"
p250_327,"I was brought up in a mining background.
"
p250_328,"I thought his speech was a disgrace.
"
p250_329,"The takeover comes as no surprise.
"
p250_330,"Job losses were also announced.
"
p250_331,"A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
"
p250_332,"We believe the world has too many refugees already.
"
p250_333,"The party lasted all night.
"
p250_334,"Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
"
p250_335,"It was nice to finish in style.
"
p250_336,"They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
"
p250_337,"Completion of the purchase is seen by the end of the year.
"
p250_338,"And he goes with it.
"
p250_339,"SCOTLAND has shown the way.
"
p250_340,"There will be good prospects ahead.
"
p250_341,"Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
"
p250_342,"The letters are going out today.
"
p250_343,"I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
"
p250_344,"We will listen to any suggestion.
"
p250_345,"The Premier League has been a huge success.
"
p250_346,"He has made his base in Spain.
"
p250_348,"A Home Office spokesman said.
"
p250_349,"Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
"
p250_350,"That is a trend which will be encouraged.
"
p250_351,"It was tough to contain the excitement.
"
p250_352,"The pain is still acute.
"
p250_353,"Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
"
p250_354,"It's wonderful to have won.
"
p250_355,"Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
"
p250_356,"I'd like to take the plunge.
"
p250_357,"Finally came the moment of truth.
"
p250_358,"We have very limited capacity.
"
p250_359,"Is our children learning ?
"
p250_360,"What form did that take ?
"
p250_361,"Are they free ?
"
p250_362,"Is there a waiting list ?
"
p250_363,"In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
"
p250_364,"Three years ago he would have been.
"
p250_365,"It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
"
p250_366,"Look at the Liberal Democrats.
"
p250_367,"The Allies intend to maintain the average.
"
p250_368,"We put our bid in last night.
"

p250_430,"He's had to suffer for the last six years.
"
p250_431,"His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
"
p250_432,"Being captain of this club is fantastic.
