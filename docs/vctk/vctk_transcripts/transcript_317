p317_001,Please call Stella.
p317_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p317_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p317_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p317_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p317_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p317_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p317_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p317_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p317_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p317_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p317_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p317_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p317_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p317_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p317_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p317_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p317_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p317_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p317_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p317_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p317_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p317_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p317_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p317_025,They have the cash to do that.
p317_026,There was a fine line to tread.
p317_027,Yet it is all for two good causes.
p317_028,It is so elusive and light.
p317_029,I am not a fan of stoppages.
p317_030,The council has been open and transparent.

p317_036,It was a policy they were against.
p317_037,Her mother said she fell off a swing.
p317_038,We see little sign of improvement.
p317_039,"The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?"
p317_040,The gaffer was great.
p317_041,"Overall, however, these were also down."
p317_042,"Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends."
p317_043,Had she enjoyed the experience?
p317_044,I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
p317_045,She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p317_046,I would think they are just behind them.
p317_047,We then went to see the headmaster.
p317_048,"As far as we are concerned, he is innocent anyway."
p317_049,There is no mandate for a regime change.
p317_050,He did the right thing by ignoring me.
p317_051,These men are a part of India.

p317_070,"And what does it cost, and who is paying?"
p317_071,I've come here for the jersey.
p317_072,This is not an optional extra.
p317_073,This is not the most crucial issue.
p317_074,"We don't know much, but we are still awaiting news."
p317_075,It's that sort of night.

p317_077,Will we ever play together again?

p317_079,I played well but missed a few chances.
p317_080,That must be left to the Parole Board.
p317_081,I'm so proud of my team.
p317_082,They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p317_083,That would open the gates of hell.

p317_085,McNaughton was not so sure.
p317_086,What did you learn in school today?

p317_090,There is no signature on this document.

p317_094,He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p317_095,"However, it is much bigger than that."

p317_097,Our approach will be different.
p317_098,Too much has already been said.
p317_099,He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p317_100,But don't worry just yet.
p317_101,This championship is different from the other majors.
p317_102,"For now, though, my future is with Rangers."

p317_105,His handling raises a wider issue.
p317_106,We have got the school holidays on.
p317_107,This is not a recipe for conflict.

p317_118,Players were held in equally low regard.
p317_119,I was in the train station overnight.
p317_120,It's to do with context.
p317_121,Now we need to keep our heads up.
p317_122,Our home is your home.
p317_123,It is essential that we win the game.
p317_124,There was no confusion over the second.

p317_126,A decision is expected shortly.
p317_127,Hear what they have to say.

p317_141,Who honestly expected anything else?
p317_142,"We are so, so lucky, so many people have died."

p317_156,I won't make an official complaint.

p317_159,She is a double victim.
p317_160,How can you not react?
p317_161,They make a selective perception process.
p317_162,There can be no compromise on that demand.
p317_163,I am totally devoted to this job.
p317_164,The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p317_165,There was an e-mail.
p317_166,That is a lot of writing.
p317_167,I try to be open to experience.
p317_168,Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p317_169,"We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence."
p317_170,It is no place for a poet.
p317_171,This is excellent value for money.
p317_172,Each day is a new beginning.
p317_173,My daughter is an adult.

p317_203,Mr Smith was dismissive.
p317_204,McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.

p317_218,We were a load of rubbish.
p317_219,Thus far we have received no complaints.
p317_220,I haven't made the donation yet.
p317_221,Other people also tried.
p317_222,But Harry has become a franchise.
p317_223,He is at war with his knee.
p317_224,"I could go on, but none of these things is true."
p317_225,I can't deny that fact.
p317_226,Clubs can only do so much.
p317_227,It's unsafe for society.
p317_228,Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
p317_229,It would have very little impact on them.
p317_230,"It would still have been a good film, but very different."
p317_231,"But, in the end, he did - and blew him away."
p317_232,I will be having talks with the workforce.
p317_233,I don't care to recall it.
p317_234,That's the whole idea.

p317_237,My life is a mess.
p317_238,He did not report it.
p317_239,You must be ready to play anyone.
p317_240,For example they could be in school uniform.
p317_241,Surely the panel was interested?
p317_242,They were even being used by primary pupils.
p317_243,It's like English in its underwear.
p317_244,This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
p317_245,I now know that from memory.
p317_246,We need to tighten up.
p317_247,I saw it at a ruck.
p317_248,This is a huge event.
p317_249,Just get on with your job.

p317_251,That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p317_252,You are not going in blind.
p317_253,They just made me feel dizzy.
p317_254,"He must have sat down, relieved it was over."
p317_255,He will do so today in Monte Carlo.

p317_266,There were no proposals on the table.
p317_267,I have spoken to head office.

p317_279,There's not much money in cycling.
p317_280,It was always open for extension.
p317_281,I think we're very different.
p317_282,"For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up."
p317_283,The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p317_284,And that is not a bad idea.
p317_285,He also has a house in Italy.
p317_286,Blood samples were taken.

p317_290,They are in care for a reason.
p317_291,They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p317_292,"In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose."
p317_293,"Obviously, Airbus is one of these."
p317_294,It got no better.
p317_295,I keep my fingers crossed.
p317_296,Some were close to tears.
p317_297,It would then be up to the judge.
p317_298,Was all this really just five months ago?
p317_299,Some reports said they had been killed.
p317_300,This is the start of a new campaign.
p317_301,It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
p317_302,The failings are serious.
p317_303,It is like a bereavement.
p317_304,I shouldn't have to put up with it.
p317_305,It could have been just a quick fix.
p317_306,I got on very well with Allan.
p317_307,That has given me great confidence.
p317_308,This is a dream come true for me.
p317_309,No other country has ever won this tournament.
p317_310,"However, there could be more bad weather to come."
p317_311,He was lying face down in the water.
p317_312,He confirmed there had been no warning.
p317_313,Ferguson did not hesitate.
p317_314,Managers and clinicians must work together.
p317_315,They didn't have a care in the world.
p317_316,I was in the zone in the morning.
p317_317,He urged people to forgive.
p317_318,"In fact, it might just be beginning."
p317_319,So he is open to ideas.
p317_320,Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
p317_321,"Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art."
p317_322,There is no right to appeal.
p317_323,We are expected to do better than before.
p317_324,"The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible."
p317_325,I am not even thinking about that.
p317_326,"Scotland is one of the favourites, with Glasgow to the fore."
p317_327,The World Trade Centre was our Main Street.
p317_328,It is good for their eyesight.
p317_329,I feel it is very irrational.
p317_330,"It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike."
p317_331,It is still with Ministers.
p317_332,The effect was almost magical.
p317_333,Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
p317_334,We are not doing the Today programme.
p317_335,"It's not that difficult, it really isn't."
p317_336,She was charged with perjury.

p317_342,"They were average apart, together superb."
p317_343,Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p317_344,"This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal."
p317_345,That never seemed likely.
p317_346,A decision is expected next March.
p317_347,We don't believe anything anymore.
p317_348,I am awaiting a reply.
p317_349,There was no need for such a hostel.
p317_350,This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p317_351,"Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages."
p317_352,There's no doubt about it.
p317_353,It just came into my head that day.
p317_354,We've always had a very positive attitude.
p317_355,What's a boy to do?
p317_356,We're not an employment agency.
p317_357,The other was the tabloids.
p317_358,They should be swept away.
p317_359,They thought the set-up there was unfair.
p317_360,I am saddened to hear of the accident.
p317_361,We want to replicate that success.
p317_362,We were lucky to have survived.
p317_363,"Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game."
p317_364,I am very happy to be here.
p317_365,He would help me with the form.
p317_366,We could easily be cut again.
p317_367,That meant the search was unlawful.
p317_368,And he goes with it.
p317_369,The actors just have to say so.
p317_370,Someone else can do the cooking that night.
p317_371,I am so lucky for that.
p317_372,It broke up my marriage.
p317_373,"He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh."
p317_374,The minister is the engineer.
p317_375,"After that, it's a step into the unknown."
p317_376,I think it was briefly considered.
p317_377,And Rangers think they have problems.
p317_378,We talk to each other about these matters.
p317_379,It's a hidden problem.
p317_380,They serve a multitude of purposes.
p317_381,There will be two other areas of contention.
p317_382,I lost a part of me.
p317_383,"Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round."
p317_384,"Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved."

p317_386,Bob Dylan is getting old.
p317_387,I never thought it would take this long.
p317_388,And he is immensely loyal.

p317_390,They think that it matters but it doesn't.

p317_392,My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p317_393,She kept him on a string.
p317_394,The committees are due to report next year.
p317_395,It's a long-term solution.
p317_396,That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
p317_397,What's the theme?
p317_398,"He takes his time, and won't be rushed."
p317_399,It shows that painting is still relevant.
p317_400,It's a very special unit.
p317_401,The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p317_402,"Davis is very supportive, as a director."
p317_403,"However, the groups denied the claims."
p317_404,It's only tackling congestion.
p317_405,And our game is about going forward.
p317_406,They will have to cut through the roof.
p317_407,Then there's one where people play for fun.
