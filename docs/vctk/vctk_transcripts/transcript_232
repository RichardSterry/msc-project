p232_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p232_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p232_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p232_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p232_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p232_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p232_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p232_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p232_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p232_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p232_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p232_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p232_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p232_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p232_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p232_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p232_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p232_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p232_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p232_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p232_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p232_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p232_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p232_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p232_025,"Johnson was pretty low.
"
p232_026,"But it failed.
"
p232_027,"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
"
p232_028,"They should be so lucky.
"
p232_029,"Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
"
p232_030,"They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
"
p232_031,"It's a matter of balance.
"
p232_032,"They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
"
p232_033,"I would love it.
"
p232_034,"It is marvellous.
"
p232_035,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p232_036,"But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
"
p232_037,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p232_038,"It was fit for royalty.
"
p232_039,"I was scared.
"
p232_040,"Dancing was her life.
"
p232_041,"I suspect the latter.
"
p232_042,"You must always attempt to raise the bar.
"
p232_043,"But it took a lot of bottle.
"
p232_044,"We will push.
"
p232_045,"It is urgent.
"
p232_046,"The judge said.
"
p232_047,"It is difficult for Ali.
"
p232_048,"But it might have done.
"
p232_049,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p232_050,"They had to explain it.
"
p232_051,"Here's a clue.
"
p232_052,"We were surprised to see the photograph.
"
p232_053,"It's the big omission.
"
p232_054,"Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
"
p232_055,"It's very odd.
"
p232_056,"Because we do not need it.
"
p232_057,"It's not pretty, but it's effective.
"
p232_058,"This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
"
p232_059,"That's the truth.
"
p232_060,"That is very hard, alone.
"
p232_061,"The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
"
p232_062,"The problems are a result of that shortfall.
"
p232_063,"You do not change overnight.
"
p232_064,"People love to see this stuff.
"
p232_065,"He was popular.
"
p232_066,"I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
"
p232_067,"Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
"
p232_068,"It is like a river running by my home.
"
p232_069,"We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
"
p232_070,"There is an element of racism in Scotland.
"
p232_071,"Painful, but only because it's true.
"
p232_072,"That was the easy election.
"
p232_073,"There could be a way back.
"
p232_074,"Then followed a bout of flu.
"
p232_075,"The price cuts are really exciting.
"
p232_076,"I had my suspicions.
"
p232_077,"It was chaotic.
"
p232_078,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p232_079,"He is now resident in England.
"
p232_080,"I've got the shirt.
"
p232_081,"Today she has been released.
"
p232_082,"What has changed ?
"
p232_083,"That is bound to happen.
"
p232_084,"I will miss him.
"
p232_085,"It's all going to clear the debt.
"
p232_086,"She had kept the news from him.
"
p232_087,"No progress has been made.
"
p232_088,"Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
"
p232_089,"Now the system is right behind us.
"
p232_090,"Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
"
p232_091,"It is a lifeline.
"
p232_092,"Today I couldn't run on it.
"
p232_093,"However, it did not end that way.
"
p232_094,"This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
"
p232_095,"I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
"
p232_096,"Then came the crunch.
"
p232_097,"The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
"
p232_098,"I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
"
p232_099,"They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
"
p232_100,"It was mayhem.
"
p232_101,"They were outside the circle.
"
p232_102,"It was a good performance.
"
p232_103,"We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
"
p232_104,"There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
"
p232_105,"That is no use.
"
p232_106,"It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
"
p232_107,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p232_108,"He pleaded for caution.
"
p232_109,"He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
"
p232_110,"I don't have many friends.
"
p232_111,"He was jailed for a year.
"
p232_112,"You had better believe it.
"
p232_113,"It's not fair.
"
p232_114,"We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
"
p232_115,"Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
"
p232_116,"Maybe this battle has been.
"
p232_117,"Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
"
p232_118,"Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
"
p232_119,"This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.
"
p232_120,"It is rubbish.
"
p232_121,"That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
"
p232_122,"The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
"
p232_123,"An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
"
p232_124,"That's all right then.
"
p232_125,"I'm so angry.
"
p232_126,"Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
"
p232_127,"It has removed a bit of guilt.
"
p232_128,"Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
"
p232_129,"The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
"
p232_130,"Offered the gold medal, he declined.
"
p232_131,"That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
"
p232_132,"I am now unemployed.
"
p232_133,"If not, a deal could take many months.
"
p232_134,"You've got to be vigilant.
"
p232_135,"Our intentions are real.
"
p232_136,"They took a risk.
"
p232_137,"The goals were good.
"
p232_138,"What will happen then ?
"
p232_139,"I am totally devoted to this job.
"
p232_140,"He is severe.
"
p232_141,"She died at her home.
"
p232_142,"I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
"
p232_143,"They did very well.
"
p232_144,"The home side didn't stand a chance.
"
p232_145,"We want to see the maximum of change.
"
p232_146,"It was deployed in the Gulf War.
"
p232_147,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p232_148,"The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
"
p232_149,"We also enjoyed a lot of support.
"
p232_150,"She had gone to the Catholic school.
"
p232_151,"It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
"
p232_152,"It was by the numbers.
"
p232_153,"I was in daily contact.
"
p232_154,"They were later discharged from hospital.
"
p232_155,"This latter point is hugely important.
"
p232_156,"It is an attitude of mind.
"
p232_158,"They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
"
p232_159,"We have to move forward.
"
p232_160,"Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
"
p232_161,"We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
"
p232_162,"Tell it like it was ?
"
p232_163,"It is not too late to get on board.
"
p232_164,"That must be left to the Parole Board.
"
p232_165,"Again, we were lucky.
"
p232_166,"Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
"
p232_167,"Waiting times for these services are too long.
"
p232_168,"That will do for me.
"
p232_169,"It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
"
p232_170,"We've made a couple of albums.
"
p232_171,"My life has been destroyed.
"
p232_172,"They thought they had found a home.
"
p232_173,"It became a book by itself.
"
p232_174,"I always felt they played for me.
"
p232_175,"You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
"
p232_176,"First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
"
p232_177,"Blair's response was weak.
"
p232_178,"It's the real thing, for sure.
"
p232_179,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p232_180,"The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
"
p232_181,"The clarity is vital.
"
p232_182,"I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
"
p232_183,"Everyone can be bought.
"
p232_184,"A career as a doctor is on hold.
"
p232_185,"Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
"
p232_186,"It is the whole package.
"
p232_187,"I've been there.
"
p232_188,"Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
"
p232_189,"They receive a high profile in the media.
"
p232_190,"We did everything by the book.
"
p232_191,"I wish I could say something.
"
p232_192,"Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
"
p232_193,"The procedure is the same in all cases.
"
p232_194,"But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
"
p232_195,"I wanted to put myself on the line.
"
p232_196,"I came home by ambulance.
"
p232_197,"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
"
p232_198,"The conference is the first test.
"
p232_199,"The service from the other players was super.
"
p232_200,"He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
"
p232_201,"On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
"
p232_202,"The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
"
p232_203,"A deadline is still essential.
"
p232_204,"We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
"
p232_205,"It's a mixture of everything.
"
p232_206,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p232_207,"I don't want to use it.
"
p232_208,"Now, it's all right.
"
p232_209,"There was an e-mail.
"
p232_210,"That's the day job.
"
p232_211,"Feel the heat ?
"
p232_212,"He knows a lot.
"
p232_213,"He is slightly confused.
"
p232_214,"She should not be blamed.
"
p232_215,"His third goal was superb.
"
p232_216,"He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
"
p232_217,"It's not ideal.
"
p232_218,"He seemed to lose his focus.
"
p232_219,"He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
"
p232_220,"The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
"
p232_221,"Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
"
p232_223,"It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
"
p232_224,"That has been the easy part.
"
p232_225,"We've got the bronze.
"
p232_226,"Mental health is a massive issue.
"
p232_227,"At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
"
p232_228,"It was good fun.
"
p232_229,"What was the main difference ?
"
p232_230,"I am immensely sad.
"
p232_231,"I'd never seen a play about me.
"
p232_232,"It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
"
p232_233,"The track is currently covered in snow.
"
p232_234,"But she was.
"
p232_235,"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
"
p232_236,"We were awful.
"
p232_237,"However, no further action was taken by police.
"
p232_238,"And thought we would get away with it.
"
p232_239,"It is set in Paris.
"
p232_240,"The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
"
p232_241,"It's quite nice.
"
p232_242,"It's quite a line-up!
"
p232_243,"It's a lovely, lovely film.
"
p232_244,"The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
"
p232_245,"Broke the birdie record.
"
p232_246,"He claimed the government had lost the plot.
"
p232_247,"She is well balanced.
"
p232_248,"A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
"
p232_249,"Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
"
p232_250,"He says that he is no different from any other man.
"
p232_251,"Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
"
p232_252,"We did not compete with any other local farmer.
"
p232_253,"I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
"
p232_254,"Some families have even requested to leave the city.
"
p232_255,"It's a record label, not a form of music.
"
p232_256,"A friendship that will endure.
"
p232_257,"I can't get a job.
"
p232_258,"He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
"
p232_259,"For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
"
p232_260,"The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
"
p232_261,"One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
"
p232_262,"It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
"
p232_263,"However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
"
p232_264,"The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
"
p232_265,"Blood samples were taken.
"
p232_266,"They want to shut the Scottish Office.
"
p232_267,"That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
"
p232_268,"Of course, that is not the whole story.
"
p232_269,"The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
"
p232_270,"Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
"
p232_271,"Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
"
p232_272,"He is a young man with a new deal.
"
p232_273,"He was also married with two children.
"
p232_274,"Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
"
p232_275,"Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
"
p232_276,"Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
"
p232_277,"She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
"
p232_278,"They wanted the club to make money.
"
p232_279,"Finally, he paid for the movie.
"
p232_280,"Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
"
p232_281,"It's a way of life.
"
p232_282,"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
"
p232_283,"I am an estate agent.
"
p232_284,"The record companies have gone through the floor.
"
p232_285,"They were on holiday in Egypt.
"
p232_286,"It was a privilege to work for him.
"
p232_287,"It happens from time to time.
"
p232_288,"He looked very sharp.
"
p232_289,"Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
"
p232_290,"I saw it at a ruck.
"
p232_291,"They were also beside themselves.
"
p232_292,"The attacker died in the crash.
"
p232_293,"The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
"
p232_294,"A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
"
p232_295,"Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
"
p232_296,"He was obviously very genuine.
"
p232_297,"These figures are truly awful.
"
p232_298,"He should have won.
"
p232_299,"He has retired.
"
p232_300,"What has altered ?
"
p232_301,"I thought it was my only chance.
"
p232_302,"Nothing is safe.
"
p232_303,"He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
"
p232_305,"They are wrong.
"
p232_306,"It is a road of death.
"
p232_307,"The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
"
p232_308,"We are in the end game.
"
p232_309,"We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
"
p232_310,"He was solid.
"
p232_311,"Special measures were needed.
"
p232_312,"There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
"
p232_313,"I never thought it would take this long.
"
p232_314,"We are a peaceful people.
"
p232_315,"Kids are terrible.
"
p232_316,"It should be equal.
"
p232_317,"Craig is a major concern for us.
"
p232_318,"The home team had an amazing start.
"
p232_319,"For the moment, our position remains the same.
"
p232_320,"Referees are easy targets.
"
p232_321,"Davis is very supportive, as a director.
"
p232_322,"However, the groups denied the claims.
"
p232_323,"I came into this world with nothing.
"
p232_324,"We think all other measures are not exhausted.
"
p232_325,"Off with their heads.
"
p232_326,"It's not long enough.
"
p232_327,"My view has now completely changed.
"
p232_328,"They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
"
p232_329,"We agreed to disagree.
"
p232_330,"It could have gone either way.
"
p232_331,"He was then replaced by Ross.
"
p232_332,"Horses are drawn by ballot.
"
p232_333,"I'd like to take the plunge.
"
p232_334,"Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
"
p232_335,"She did not attend the courtroom.
"
p232_336,"It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
"
p232_337,"His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
"
p232_338,"The team for the first game could be this one.
"
p232_339,"They haven't got a hope.
"
p232_340,"Who will do it ?
"
p232_341,"Gaelic provision continued to be good.
"
p232_342,"That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
"
p232_343,"He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
"
p232_344,"He has to learn.
"
p232_345,"Indeed, it was magical.
"
p232_346,"Tiger is the exception.
"
p232_347,"Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
"
p232_348,"That is the very reason why it was so vital.
"
p232_349,"I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
"
p232_350,"Chambers said he would accept the place.
"
p232_351,"Everything was an effort.
"
p232_352,"The boat was fantastic.
"
p232_353,"Like his acting, it was an accident.
"
p232_354,"It is long gone.
