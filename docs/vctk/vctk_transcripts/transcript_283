p283_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p283_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p283_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p283_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p283_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p283_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p283_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p283_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p283_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p283_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p283_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p283_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p283_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p283_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p283_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p283_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p283_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p283_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p283_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p283_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p283_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p283_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p283_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p283_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p283_025,"That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
"
p283_026,"We are a service industry.
"
p283_027,"It's not going to work out that way.
"
p283_028,"The idea is not new.
"
p283_029,"Because we do not need it.
"
p283_030,"And we have a singer.
"
p283_031,"Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
"
p283_032,"We speak about the performance.
"
p283_033,"It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
"
p283_034,"Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
"
p283_035,"It could well be the case.
"
p283_036,"It is not for any other purpose.
"
p283_037,"That means an extra two years.
"
p283_038,"You must always attempt to raise the bar.
"
p283_039,"He is believed to live in Britain.
"
p283_040,"Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
"
p283_041,"She hopes to study in Britain one day.
"
p283_042,"The boy is no longer with us.
"
p283_043,"There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
"
p283_044,"But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
"
p283_045,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p283_046,"I was released after six days.
"
p283_047,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p283_048,"Every aspect of our play was first class.
"
p283_049,"No details of the talks were given.
"
p283_050,"Clearly, they had other problems.
"
p283_051,"It also opened a branch in Livingston.
"
p283_052,"I would say the position is open.
"
p283_053,"That was the theory, anyway.
"
p283_054,"I had come back from London.
"
p283_055,"I was inspired by two things.
"
p283_056,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p283_057,"There was no safety net.
"
p283_058,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p283_059,"How are you, sir ?
"
p283_060,"So is that it, then ?
"
p283_061,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p283_062,"What do we do ?
"
p283_063,"He also presented You Bet!
"
p283_064,"Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
"
p283_065,"I expect a rapid response.
"
p283_066,"We felt it was sufficient.
"
p283_067,"This is the year of the Tiger.
"
p283_068,"The motive for the shooting was not known.
"
p283_069,"We believe a third party was involved.
"
p283_070,"The Government should be ashamed.
"
p283_071,"There's still plenty time left.
"
p283_072,"You do not change overnight.
"
p283_073,"There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
"
p283_074,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p283_075,"We will pay their bills.
"
p283_076,"He is a young man with a new deal.
"
p283_077,"He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
"
p283_078,"Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
"
p283_079,"It is very special for me.
"
p283_080,"The tournament has now been cancelled.
"
p283_081,"They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
"
p283_082,"We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
"
p283_083,"The girls are so lucky to be alive.
"
p283_084,"Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
"
p283_085,"The result is a vacuum.
"
p283_086,"It looks like a hit.
"
p283_087,"I'd like to see the business case.
"
p283_088,"It makes for an interesting conference.
"
p283_089,"I've had it for the exams.
"
p283_090,"You have to respect the office.
"
p283_091,"He has been a success this year.
"
p283_092,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p283_093,"We have to offer value for money.
"
p283_094,"It's so hard to shift.
"
p283_095,"They lived for their children.
"
p283_096,"Potions said he would drive.
"
p283_097,"The trick is to try it.
"
p283_098,"Little is known about them.
"
p283_099,"However, it did not end that way.
"
p283_100,"It really was an unusual award.
"
p283_101,"IT has been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
"
p283_102,"The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
"
p283_103,"We could not get any possession.
"
p283_104,"That is the important thing.
"
p283_105,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p283_106,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p283_107,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p283_108,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p283_109,"And does it ?
"
p283_110,"However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
"
p283_111,"It's good to have a voice.
"
p283_112,"However, we have not come to any conclusions.
"
p283_113,"There is a contract in existence for Allan.
"
p283_114,"Their attitude is all wrong.
"
p283_115,"We made a world record together.
"
p283_116,"A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
"
p283_117,"It's for that reason he should resign.
"
p283_118,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p283_119,"It's been a long wait.
"
p283_120,"There is no credible official announcement.
"
p283_121,"Our house was very small.
"
p283_122,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p283_123,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p283_124,"Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
"
p283_125,"Sport is good for you.
"
p283_126,"It was won on the issue of the land.
"
p283_127,"I am a committed European.
"
p283_128,"From it emerged a cup.
"
p283_129,"That was the first step.
"
p283_130,"That might help a bit.
"
p283_131,"It is a delight on every level.
"
p283_132,"We would make a start.
"
p283_133,"Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
"
p283_134,"Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
"
p283_135,"They keep the atmosphere in mind.
"
p283_136,"It does not even have a staff shortage.
"
p283_137,"This should begin in October.
"
p283_138,"However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
"
p283_139,"We did what we had to do.
"
p283_140,"If not, a deal could take many months.
"
p283_141,"But it is different in different regions.
"
p283_142,"Last night, the row continued.
"
p283_143,"You've got to be vigilant.
"
p283_144,"Glasgow is a friendly city.
"
p283_145,"We are entirely happy with Russell.
"
p283_146,"It's not a U-turn at all.
"
p283_147,"And I have some advice for my old friend.
"
p283_148,"He was a home referee.
"
p283_149,"Before it was an ordeal.
"
p283_150,"I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
"
p283_151,"In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
"
p283_152,"I'm so grateful for that.
"
p283_153,"It will be retained as part of the group.
"
p283_154,"Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
"
p283_155,"Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
"
p283_156,"I am just trying to do my job.
"
p283_157,"It opens the door to the Champions League.
"
p283_158,"It has become a way of life.
"
p283_159,"I was caught out a little bit.
"
p283_160,"This will secure the future of our industry.
"
p283_161,"The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
"
p283_162,"The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
"
p283_163,"There's only one team in Ayrshire.
"
p283_164,"What happened in that game ?
"
p283_165,"Are you going to win ?
"
p283_166,"Was it the wife ?
"
p283_167,"Why change it ?
"
p283_168,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p283_169,"It has to be an event.
"
p283_170,"Three hours later, the man was free.
"
p283_171,"We have a clean bill of health.
"
p283_172,"It was by the numbers.
"
p283_173,"Today I had no failures in my team.
"
p283_174,"My Dad is a hero.
"
p283_175,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p283_176,"He was asked to quit.
"
p283_177,"There is no reason at all.
"
p283_178,"The woman was his wife.
"
p283_179,"This action reflects a slump in bookings.
"
p283_180,"They should stop the bombing.
"
p283_181,"The research was my life.
"
p283_182,"I'd love to be like Peter.
"
p283_183,"The suspension of the head teacher has been lifted.
"
p283_184,"I am a good player.
"
p283_185,"He was in great spirits.
"
p283_186,"It's never great to finish second.
"
p283_187,"We have a budget in March.
"
p283_188,"Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
"
p283_189,"Nobody did in those days.
"
p283_190,"Well, this article is a bit like that.
"
p283_191,"It's nice to be nice.
"
p283_192,"The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
"
p283_193,"There was no hint of scandal.
"
p283_194,"It was to be inclusive.
"
p283_195,"I feel like my game has come a long way.
"
p283_196,"The Hibs manager is no fool.
"
p283_197,"The expansion will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
"
p283_198,"If that's the case, he will struggle.
"
p283_199,"The hotel was now for sale.
"
p283_200,"I'm just going to hit the shot.
"
p283_201,"Does the name matter ?
"
p283_202,"how do you get it back ?
"
p283_203,"What are you not good at ?
"
p283_204,"I think, therefore I am ?
"
p283_205,"Who was she ?
"
p283_206,"Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
"
p283_207,"They receive a high profile in the media.
"
p283_208,"They bought the property four years ago.
"
p283_209,"She was married with one son.
"
p283_210,"They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
"
p283_211,"A copy of the report will be sent to the them.
"
p283_212,"We are not making any comment.
"
p283_213,"It could be done by experts and lawyers.
"
p283_214,"He lives in a neighbouring village.
"
p283_215,"It was a bit like having children.
"
p283_216,"But there's an upturn in the sector.
"
p283_217,"I will work on her.
"
p283_218,"We represent a wide range of society.
"
p283_219,"We always felt we could win.
"
p283_220,"This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
"
p283_221,"They are still very quiet.
"
p283_222,"Pulled a huge number of viewers.
"
p283_223,"I came home by ambulance.
"
p283_224,"It comes from reflection or thinking.
"
p283_225,"It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
"
p283_226,"You could feel the heat.
"
p283_227,"I suggest a new plan.
"
p283_228,"That is the real test.
"
p283_229,"Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
"
p283_230,"The early physical reports were clear.
"
p283_231,"Consumers have the right to choose.
"
p283_232,"The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.

p283_233,"This is a holy place.
"
p283_234,"The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
"
p283_235,"This will take several weeks.
"
p283_236,"The research is published in the journal, Nature.

p283_243,"I'm just a regular person.
"
p283_244,"It was finally agreed on Saturday.
"
p283_245,"It was a great experience.
"
p283_246,"His second was a beauty.
"
p283_247,"These will take a little time to develop.
"
p283_248,"There's a chance they might come down.
"
p283_249,"This is an exciting time for the party.
"
p283_250,"For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
"
p283_251,"The problem was you thought you were a big man.
"
p283_252,"It was a crazy day.
"
p283_253,"A career as a doctor is on hold.
"
p283_254,"Our future is in their hands.
"
p283_255,"This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
"
p283_256,"It could be to do with the location.
"
p283_257,"We played them off the pitch.
"
p283_258,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p283_259,"A small number of new jobs will also be created.
"
p283_260,"At the time, he was a living legend.

"
p283_263,"He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
"
p283_264,"She claimed the day was for young people.
"
p283_265,"It depends on Labour, not on us.
"
p283_266,"It had so much to do with output.
"
p283_267,"She died in middle age.
"
p283_268,"And they were being paid ?
"
p283_269,"was everything done to save people ?
"
p283_270,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p283_271,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p283_272,"Is it in the right place ?
"
p283_273,"Did he trip ?
"
p283_274,"That takes a lot of courage.
"
p283_275,"On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
"
p283_276,"The irony was not lost.
"
p283_277,"I would do away with the dress code.
"
p283_278,"Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
"
p283_279,"The minister is the engineer.

"
p283_282,"Kingfisher can afford to wait.
"
p283_283,"Nato was not a love affair.
"
p283_284,"You can never tell with the manager.
"
p283_285,"We need to establish the facts.
"
p283_286,"Persuaded to change his mind.
"
p283_287,"There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
"
p283_288,"Paterson can afford to be generous.
"
p283_289,"My son was too young to die.
"
p283_290,"I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
"
p283_291,"I should think so, too.
"
p283_292,"My office is down there.
"
p283_293,"None of the agencies was able to help.

p283_296,"He looked like a schoolboy.
"
p283_297,"They are very keen to work with us.
"
p283_298,"This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
"
p283_299,"The next month is very important.
"
p283_300,"I would have the hammer in the crowd.
"
p283_301,"This is a total mystery.
"
p283_302,"At first I thought I was gone.
"
p283_303,"It is the end of an adventure.
"
p283_304,"It has the potential to be another North Sea.
"
p283_305,"It looks as though he will be right.
"
p283_306,"As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
"
p283_307,"It was an easy decision to come here.
"
p283_308,"The target is to break even by Christmas.
"
p283_309,"Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
"
p283_310,"My whole life has changed.
"
p283_311,"It was never a free kick.

p283_312,"It further expressed his defiance.
"
p283_313,"He said he was sorry.
"
p283_314,"It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
"
p283_315,"The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
"
p283_316,"We have to be very, very careful.
"
p283_317,"It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
"
p283_318,"If not, he should go home.
"
p283_319,"He is well respected by his colleagues.
"
p283_320,"Hopefully, this week will be good.
"
p283_321,"This is the correct decision.
"
p283_322,"Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
"
p283_323,"The Project is far from that.
"
p283_324,"What form did that take ?
"
p283_326,"What are they for ?
"
p283_327,"Is there a waiting list ?
"
p283_328,"Do they think anyone else wants them ?
"
p283_329,"So what happens next ?
"
p283_330,"He will address the nation this evening.
"
p283_331,"The attacker died in the crash.
"
p283_332,"We would hope to make progress on that next year.
"
p283_333,"No final decision has been taken.
"
p283_334,"In Europe, it is always over two games.
"
p283_335,"I was there five months ago.
"
p283_336,"Well, he can do it.
"
p283_337,"The songs are just so good.
"
p283_338,"And it's a goodbye from him.
"
p283_339,"We need to increase the membership.
"
p283_340,"A new school will be built.
"
p283_341,"This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
"
p283_342,"The capital costs are modest.
"
p283_343,"It became a book by itself.
"
p283_344,"Cast Away now on general release.
"
p283_345,"Like many companies, it is a problem.
"
p283_346,"The party lasted all night.
"
p283_347,"But I think it's different from the rest!
"
p283_348,"It is a matter of clarity.
"
p283_349,"He did that every night I was with him.
"
p283_350,"They come to enjoy themselves.
"
p283_351,"Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
"
p283_352,"Another reason is a shortage of stock.
"
p283_353,"And he goes with it.
"
p283_354,"My life is exactly the same.
"
p283_356,"He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
"
p283_357,"We want to play at the worlds.
"
p283_358,"We will listen to any suggestion.
"
