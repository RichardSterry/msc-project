p257_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p257_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p257_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p257_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p257_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p257_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p257_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p257_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p257_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p257_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p257_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p257_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p257_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p257_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p257_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p257_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p257_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p257_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p257_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p257_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p257_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p257_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p257_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p257_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p257_025,"We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
"
p257_026,"Is this accurate?
"
p257_027,"They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
"
p257_028,"Because we do not need it.
"
p257_029,"Life was like a timetable.
"
p257_030,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p257_031,"It was clear.
"
p257_032,"Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
"
p257_033,"I came to complete.
"
p257_034,"President Bush is at war.
"
p257_035,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p257_036,"I was scared.
"
p257_037,"It was ugly.
"
p257_038,"It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
"
p257_039,"It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
"
p257_040,"The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
"
p257_041,"A neighbour said.
"
p257_042,"We need to chat.
"
p257_043,"The boy is no longer with us.
"
p257_044,"I hate the word.
"
p257_045,"That should do it.
"
p257_046,"It's a blessing.
"
p257_047,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p257_048,"As she explains.
"
p257_049,"Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
"
p257_050,"He had no enemies.
"
p257_051,"I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
"
p257_052,"But the law is very clear on this.
"
p257_053,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p257_054,"We were surprised to see the photograph.
"
p257_055,"Next league matches Celtic.
"
p257_056,"It's very odd.
"
p257_057,"The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
"
p257_058,"It is not great art.
"
p257_059,"George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
"
p257_060,"There was a battle there.
"
p257_061,"Scotland had great assets.
"
p257_062,"There will be tough opponents to this report.
"
p257_063,"Have a look at our accounts.
"
p257_064,"Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
"
p257_065,"There is an element of racism in Scotland.
"
p257_066,"I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
"
p257_067,"It's all I can do.
"
p257_068,"There could be a way back.
"
p257_069,"They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
"
p257_070,"The price cuts are really exciting.
"
p257_071,"Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
"
p257_072,"I had my suspicions.
"
p257_073,"She died in hospital two hours later.
"
p257_074,"It was chaotic.
"
p257_075,"Is there a new way forward?
"
p257_076,"I've not thought about it.
"
p257_077,"People must remain vigilant.
"
p257_078,"Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
"
p257_079,"It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
"
p257_080,"It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
"
p257_081,"It may well have been.
"
p257_082,"He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
"
p257_083,"He seems to be pleased with the picture.
"
p257_084,"Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
"
p257_085,"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
"
p257_086,"It's never too late.
"
p257_087,"Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
"
p257_088,"Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
"
p257_089,"Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
"
p257_090,"Today I couldn't run on it.
"
p257_091,"We must look forward.
"
p257_092,"It is an old family habit.
"
p257_093,"He was possessed
"
p257_094,"She told The Herald.
"
p257_095,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p257_096,"The peace process will be buried!
"
p257_097,"The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
"
p257_098,"They are now divorced.
"
p257_099,"They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
"
p257_100,"It was mayhem.
"
p257_101,"However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
"
p257_102,"Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
"
p257_103,"We have every respect for Michelle.
"
p257_104,"That time is not now, however.
"
p257_105,"I didn't play well last year.
"
p257_106,"For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
"
p257_107,"They will want to perform well.
"
p257_108,"They had to be cut from the wreckage.
"
p257_109,"I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
"
p257_110,"It is normal.
"
p257_111,"I was fighting for my life, I thought.
"
p257_112,"I don't have many friends.
"
p257_113,"It's a shame.
"
p257_114,"It was the eighties.
"
p257_115,"We do not expect any surplus.
"
p257_116,"Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
"
p257_117,"It's not a new concept in jazz.
"
p257_118,"We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
"
p257_119,"I'm delighted about that.
"
p257_120,"Does this mean.
"
p257_121,"This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
"
p257_122,"He did his job.
"
p257_123,"You can spend money on housing.
"
p257_124,"That's all right then.
"
p257_125,"I was furious.
"
p257_126,"It has removed a bit of guilt.
"
p257_127,"His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
"
p257_128,"It's terrible that he has died the same way.
"
p257_129,"So the European elections are extremely important.
"
p257_130,"Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
"
p257_131,"Who will attend?
"
p257_132,"The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
"
p257_133,"The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
"
p257_134,"I am now unemployed.
"
p257_135,"Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
"
p257_136,"They made such decisions in London.
"
p257_137,"Our intentions are real.
"
p257_138,"It is also well received.
"
p257_139,"What will happen then?
"
p257_140,"It's not true.
"
p257_141,"I feel very grateful with everything.
"
p257_142,"We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
"
p257_143,"Nobody in the world can get away from him.
"
p257_144,"He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
"
p257_145,"We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
"
p257_146,"There is a lack of chemistry.
"
p257_147,"That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
"
p257_148,"It is like a football team.
"
p257_149,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p257_150,"He will emerge as a world leader.
"
p257_151,"It opens the door to the Champions League.
"
p257_152,"They did very well.
"
p257_153,"It became a book by itself.
"
p257_154,"But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
"
p257_155,"The weather forecast isn't good.
"
p257_156,"There's a sense of excess in the novel.
"
p257_157,"For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
"
p257_158,"There's a pause.
"
p257_159,"He can do no wrong.
"
p257_160,"It was so new, so exciting.
"
p257_161,"I've learned from my mistakes.
"
p257_162,"A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
"
p257_163,"I've put my own money into this project.
"
p257_164,"However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
"
p257_165,"I lost my head.
"
p257_166,"You are not going in blind.
"
p257_167,"Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
"
p257_168,"As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
"
p257_169,"And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
"
p257_170,"My life has been destroyed.
"
p257_171,"There was no hint of scandal.
"
p257_172,"Treatment is not an issue with these people.
"
p257_173,"I feel like my game has come a long way.
"
p257_174,"We wanted it left for a wee while.
"
p257_175,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p257_176,"It's quite a routine.
"
p257_177,"There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
"
p257_178,"In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
"
p257_179,"Everyone can be bought.
"
p257_180,"It is minute.
"
p257_181,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p257_182,"What has caused the demise of singing?
"
p257_183,"One was a lawyer.
"
p257_184,"My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
"
p257_185,"It was an odd affair, in many respects.
"
p257_186,"Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
"
p257_187,"Saturday is gone.
"
p257_188,"I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
"
p257_189,"Last night was a key episode.
"
p257_190,"We must keep our feet on the ground.
"
p257_191,"The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
"
p257_192,"Off I went.
"
p257_193,"There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
"
p257_194,"He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
"
p257_195,"Ferguson should take note.
"
p257_196,"The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
"
p257_197,"It's just awful.
"
p257_198,"We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
"
p257_199,"IT S all in the hair.
"
p257_200,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p257_201,"But I am a worried man.
"
p257_202,"This gives a financial incentive to switch.
"
p257_203,"Saddam Hussein is a devil.
"
p257_204,"He knows a lot.
"
p257_205,"He is slightly confused.
"
p257_206,"Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
"
p257_207,"We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
"
p257_208,"I am delighted for Simon.
"
p257_209,"It had all been arranged.
"
p257_210,"A Grampian Police spokesman said.
"
p257_211,"We have got to get it right.
"
p257_212,"However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
"
p257_213,"I might come back.
"
p257_214,"His death was a tragic accident.
"
p257_215,"It's just a place to open it.
"
p257_216,"He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
"
p257_217,"Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
"
p257_218,"William Hague delighted his party.
"
p257_219,"At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
"
p257_220,"We played them off the pitch.
"
p257_221,"She really suffered for her art.
"
p257_222,"He demanded to speak to the boss.
"
p257_223,"Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
"
p257_224,"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
"
p257_225,"I think he's the favourite, no question.
"
p257_226,"Broke the birdie record.
"
p257_227,"They had no children.
"
p257_228,"It is set in Paris.
"
p257_229,"Well, they were the unlucky ones.
"
p257_230,"The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
"
p257_231,"On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
"
p257_232,"John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow.
"
p257_233,"But it's a subtle process.
"
p257_234,"The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
"
p257_235,"My future is in the marathon.
"
p257_236,"Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
"
p257_237,"A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
"
p257_238,"They may yet have the last laugh.
"
p257_239,"You can feel at home in China.
"
p257_240,"It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
"
p257_241,"I should think so, too.
"
p257_242,"We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
"
p257_243,"I didn't need to watch it on the video.
"
p257_244,"He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
"
p257_245,"I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
"
p257_246,"We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
"
p257_247,"He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
"
p257_248,"He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
"
p257_249,"I watched a game.
"
p257_250,"They are interior designers and architects.
"
p257_251,"There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
"
p257_252,"they fail to engage.
"
p257_253,"It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
"
p257_254,"I would have the hammer in the crowd.
"
p257_255,"He thought he had a month to cross the street.
"
p257_256,"He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
"
p257_257,"Blood samples were taken.
"
p257_258,"He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
"
p257_259,"It's very nice.
"
p257_260,"Frankly, we should all have such problems.
"
p257_261,"Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
"
p257_262,"We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
"
p257_263,"And Michael was just great.
"
p257_264,"We're in shock.
"
p257_265,"Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
"
p257_266,"Our objective is to tackle poverty.
"
p257_267,"One knows the feeling.
"
p257_268,"She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
"
p257_269,"She looked so young.
"
p257_270,"It was a privilege to work for him.
"
p257_271,"For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
"
p257_272,"He looked very sharp.
"
p257_273,"You've got to have both sides.
"
p257_274,"Who did the recruiting?
"
p257_275,"Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
"
p257_276,"Well, he can do it.
"
p257_277,"It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
"
p257_278,"It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
"
p257_279,"He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
"
p257_280,"The results are sometimes contentious.
"
p257_281,"He should have won.
"
p257_282,"A new school will be built.
"
p257_283,"Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
"
p257_284,"That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
"
p257_285,"What has altered?
"
p257_286,"The home was now under new management.
"
p257_287,"Graeme was prepared.
"
p257_288,"I thought it was my only chance.
"
p257_289,"However, the snow was welcomed by some.
"
p257_290,"It just came into my head that day.
"
p257_291,"They are wrong.
"
p257_292,"Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
"
p257_293,"It's just not funny!
"
p257_294,"I am very happy to be here.
"
p257_295,"The plot is minimal.
"
p257_296,"It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
"
p257_297,"A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
"
p257_298,"This is the culture change in medicine.
"
p257_299,"and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
"
p257_300,"They were fantastic.
"
p257_301,"I never thought it would take this long.
"
p257_302,"In fact, they have the opposite effect.
"
p257_303,"They wanted the club to make money.
"
p257_304,"Kids are terrible.
"
p257_305,"Henman has been warned.
"
p257_306,"It should be equal.
"
p257_307,"Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
"
p257_308,"The home team had an amazing start.
"
p257_309,"It is out there.
"
p257_310,"They had a confession.
"
p257_311,"Davis is very supportive, as a director.
"
p257_312,"We are in the end game.
"
p257_313,"I came into this world with nothing.
"
p257_314,"But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
"
p257_315,"I am so upset.
"
p257_316,"The boat was fantastic.
"
p257_317,"I saw some good things.
"
p257_318,"Finally, he paid for the movie.
"
p257_319,"You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
"
p257_320,"In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
"
p257_321,"Three years ago he would have been.
"
p257_322,"You feel the pride.
"
p257_323,"It is so unfair.
"
p257_324,"The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
"
p257_325,"Indeed, it was magical.
"
p257_326,"I've got no secret.
"
p257_327,"Look at the witnesses.
"
p257_328,"I'm very lucky.
"
p257_329,"We must do something.
"
p257_330,"He says that he is no different from any other man.
"
p257_331,"Alex Ferguson is the same.
"
p257_332,"I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
"
p257_333,"Like his acting, it was an accident.
"
p257_334,"It is not like working for a living.
"
p257_335,"It is long gone.
"
p257_336,"The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
"
p257_337,"Tell us about it.
"
p257_338,"The salary changes are long overdue.
"
p257_339,"He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
"
p257_340,"It was very formal.
"
p257_341,"The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
"
p257_342,"Tyson is overwhelmed.
"
p257_343,"We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
"
p257_344,"I wanted to go out on a high.
"
p257_345,"Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
"
p257_346,"I felt really good until Friday.
"
p257_347,"His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
"
p257_348,"He could face a jail sentence.
"
p257_349,"For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
"
p257_350,"I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
"

p257_356,"He knew his job inside out.
"
p257_357,"I wouldn't want to miss that chance.

"
p257_360,"I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while.
"
p257_361,"He has the edge.
"
p257_362,"He denied the charge.
"
p257_363,"There were no casualties.
"
p257_364,"Since then, he has played no active part in the company.

"
p257_371,"This year I understood.
"
p257_372,"I'm pleased about one thing.
"
p257_373,"It is unusual.
"
p257_374,"It is also claimed that he was murdered.
"

"
p257_376,"I can lead by example.
"
p257_377,"Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
"
p257_378,"They are good.
"
p257_379,"He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.

"
p257_390,"There was no trouble.
"
p257_391,"This is a huge confidence boost.
"
p257_392,"Not because they want to sing about something.
"
p257_393,"It is not a standing army.

"
p257_399,"We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.

p257_400,"I am the Son of Sam.
"
p257_401,"She is superb.
"
p257_402,"Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.

"
p257_411,"Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
"
p257_412,"I recommend a tour.
"
p257_413,"We are delighted with this outcome.

p257_414,"I have so much respect for him.

"
p257_428,"It had been in place since last July.
