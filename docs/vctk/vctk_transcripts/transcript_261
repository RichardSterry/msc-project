p261_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p261_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p261_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p261_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p261_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p261_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p261_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p261_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p261_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p261_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p261_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p261_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p261_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p261_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p261_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p261_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p261_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p261_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p261_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p261_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p261_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p261_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p261_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p261_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p261_025,"They are very clever in their use of words.
"
p261_026,"Meetings will also remain private.
"
p261_027,"Because we do not need it.
"
p261_028,"Life was like a timetable.
"
p261_029,"Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
"
p261_030,"We will look into it.
"
p261_031,"I have never been a member of the council.
"
p261_032,"It was a close call.
"
p261_033,"That means an extra two years.
"
p261_034,"This film will be totally awesome.
"
p261_035,"That was the case with David.
"
p261_036,"He is believed to live in Britain.
"
p261_037,"Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
"
p261_038,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p261_039,"Their campaign is in disarray.
"
p261_040,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p261_041,"I was released after six days.
"
p261_042,"That's been the difference between the sides.
"
p261_043,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p261_044,"I would love to have him home.
"
p261_045,"He will need that machine.
"
p261_046,"It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
"
p261_047,"It had little effect on European equity markets.
"
p261_048,"Pulled a huge number of viewers.
"
p261_049,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p261_050,"There was no safety net.
"
p261_051,"I must take a seat.
"
p261_052,"It is on the news.
"
p261_053,"The motive for the shooting was not known.
"
p261_054,"Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
"
p261_055,"The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
"
p261_056,"We will pay their bills.
"
p261_057,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p261_058,"How are you, sir ?
"
p261_059,"So is that it, then ?
"
p261_060,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p261_061,"What do we do ?
"
p261_062,"I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
"
p261_063,"Only water is currently allowed.
"
p261_064,"He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
"
p261_065,"It's not covered by the insurance.
"
p261_066,"Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
"
p261_067,"That's not the intention at all.
"
p261_068,"It starts with the script.
"
p261_069,"There could be a way back.
"
p261_070,"They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
"
p261_071,"Then followed a bout of flu.
"
p261_072,"The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
"
p261_073,"The price cuts are really exciting.
"
p261_074,"He is now resident in England.
"
p261_075,"These people are not big names.
"
p261_076,"After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
"
p261_077,"He is in the queue.
"
p261_078,"Both agreed on the success of the event.
"
p261_079,"Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
"
p261_080,"We have to offer value for money.
"
p261_081,"Our mother is very worried.
"
p261_082,"Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
"
p261_083,"They lived for their children.
"
p261_084,"Potions said he would drive.
"
p261_085,"They deserve a lot of credit.
"
p261_086,"However, it did not end that way.
"
p261_087,"I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
"
p261_088,"It is high time to act.
"
p261_089,"The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
"
p261_090,"However, on this showing it's going to be a difficult task.
"
p261_091,"We could not get any possession.
"
p261_092,"It was clear on Thursday.
"
p261_093,"But it is up again.
"
p261_094,"All the pressure will be on him.
"
p261_095,"You are like an animal.
"
p261_096,"The move follows a review of the Singapore
"
p261_097,"If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
"
p261_098,"I had a ball today.
"
p261_099,"No, the equipment is extra.
"
p261_100,"It is a good lifestyle.
"
p261_101,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p261_102,"We are also looking for new licences.
"
p261_103,"Our house was very small.
"
p261_104,"It was a funny game.
"
p261_105,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p261_106,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p261_107,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p261_108,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p261_109,"And does it ?
"
p261_110,"He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
"
p261_111,"I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
"
p261_112,"It became a national network.
"
p261_113,"He thought she was amazing.
"
p261_114,"Maybe this battle has been.
"
p261_115,"It isn't a happy memory.
"
p261_116,"Actors like to be in the centre.
"
p261_117,"It's not a quick fix.
"
p261_118,"But it took a lot of bottle.
"
p261_119,"Structural changes were also required.
"
p261_120,"I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
"
p261_121,"It is too pretty, it is too small.
"
p261_122,"I was on a roll.
"
p261_123,"The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
"
p261_124,"My life has changed a lot.
"
p261_125,"If not, a deal could take many months.
"
p261_126,"That would open the gates of hell.
"
p261_127,"He can perform well under pressure.
"
p261_128,"I have accepted the challenge.
"
p261_129,"You are a gambling man.
"
p261_130,"He is a great addition to our team.
"
p261_131,"This is a successful outcome.
"
p261_132,"I love the spectacle of cinema.
"
p261_133,"This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
"
p261_134,"We will try to find someone.
"
p261_135,"The others have all been in storage for some time.
"
p261_136,"She died at her home.
"
p261_137,"We could easily have lost that game.
"
p261_138,"Check that he is dead.
"
p261_139,"Several messages can be taken from the occasion.
"
p261_140,"Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
"
p261_141,"Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
"
p261_142,"Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
"
p261_143,"The balance isn't there at EMI.
"
p261_144,"I would relish the prospect.
"
p261_145,"It has become a way of life.
"
p261_146,"Like the others, he was arrested.
"
p261_147,"The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
"
p261_148,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p261_149,"The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
"
p261_150,"It was by the numbers.
"
p261_151,"But I am still awaiting an answer.
"
p261_152,"We will turn the corner.
"
p261_153,"He was asked to quit.
"
p261_154,"This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
"
p261_155,"The strong pound also took its toll.
"
p261_156,"These days are long gone.
"
p261_157,"The bank was now involved.
"
p261_158,"We have to move forward.
"
p261_159,"The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
"
p261_160,"We knew we had the goal we wanted.
"
p261_161,"The pension levels will remain the same.
"
p261_162,"I would probably have to agree with him.
"
p261_163,"You had to go and see him.
"
p261_164,"Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
"
p261_165,"Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
"
p261_166,"The region is open for business.
"
p261_167,"They could not match it.
"
p261_168,"What happened in that game ?
"
p261_169,"Are you going to win ?
"
p261_170,"Was it the wife ?
"
p261_171,"Why change it ?
"
p261_172,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p261_173,"This is no reflection on Rangers.
"
p261_174,"I always felt they played for me.
"
p261_175,"You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
"
p261_176,"It is a body blow.
"
p261_177,"The jury is still out.
"
p261_178,"It is not either national standards or local control.
"
p261_179,"City sentiment is in his favour.
"
p261_180,"I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
"
p261_181,"These men could be anywhere in the world.
"
p261_182,"I will be in Scotland.
"
p261_183,"Says the Duke of York.
"
p261_184,"Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
"
p261_185,"I had too much to drink.
"
p261_186,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p261_187,"He prefers to play for them.
"
p261_188,"That is a waste of energy.
"
p261_189,"It could be done by experts and lawyers.
"
p261_190,"DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
"
p261_191,"That was the theory, anyway.
"
p261_192,"It was a pre-emptive strike.
"
p261_193,"It had been in place since last July.
"
p261_194,"Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
"
p261_195,"This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
"
p261_196,"It's very difficult to find a buyer.
"
p261_197,"We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
"
p261_198,"He should emerge as the winner.
"
p261_199,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p261_200,"I made a terrible start.
"
p261_201,"It was a moment of madness.
"
p261_202,"We believe a third party was involved.
"
p261_203,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p261_204,"It was his own decision.
"
p261_205,"Does the name matter ?
"
p261_206,"how do you get it back ?
"
p261_207,"What are you not good at ?
"
p261_208,"I think, therefore I am ?
"
p261_209,"Who was she ?
"
p261_210,"A deadline is still essential.
"
p261_211,"I chose to go by the rules.
"
p261_212,"I won't make an official complaint.
"
p261_213,"It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
"
p261_214,"They are looking at a flotation.
"
p261_215,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p261_216,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p261_217,"It was far from business as usual.
"
p261_218,"All will be revealed in due course.
"
p261_219,"They have known the hard times.
"
p261_220,"It has been like that all year for me.
"
p261_221,"Construction is due to begin in February.
"
p261_222,"Seven people were critically injured.
"
p261_223,"My daughter is an adult.
"
p261_224,"IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
"
p261_225,"He must get to know himself.
"
p261_226,"It was a day for records.
"
p261_227,"For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
"
p261_228,"And the World Cup has not even begun.
"
p261_229,"Life is too short to be bitter.
"
p261_230,"A terrorist is a terrorist.
"
p261_231,"It could be to do with the location.
"
p261_232,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p261_233,"The statement contained no surprises.
"
p261_234,"A small number of new jobs will also be created.
"
p261_235,"Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
"
p261_236,"They have not been in touch with the club.
"
p261_237,"I need a publishing deal!
"
p261_238,"They tried to give her advice.
"
p261_239,"In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
"
p261_240,"Of course, that is not the whole story.
"
p261_241,"No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
"
p261_242,"This is a family club.
"
p261_243,"It is the loss of my name.
"
p261_244,"I haven't made the donation yet.
"
p261_245,"Well, they were the unlucky ones.
"
p261_246,"The irony was not lost.
"
p261_247,"We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
"
p261_248,"It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
"
p261_249,"I was just a kid.
"
p261_250,"It is now the big brother.
"
p261_251,"They showed a lot of heart.
"
p261_252,"Nato was not a love affair.
"
p261_253,"He is due in Israel tomorrow.
"
p261_254,"It was a poor performance.
"
p261_255,"That is the consistent approach of the Government.
"
p261_256,"We want to play at the worlds.
"
p261_257,"Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
"
p261_258,"We will listen to any suggestion.
"
p261_259,"Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
"
p261_260,"I should think so, too.
"
p261_261,"No production contract is yet in sight.
"
p261_262,"There will be widespread support on all sides.
"
p261_263,"It seems a shame to leave it.
"
p261_264,"My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
"
p261_265,"This idea has been around for four years.
"
p261_266,"The concerns are the same.
"
p261_267,"I can't get a job.
"
p261_268,"And they were being paid ?
"
p261_269,"was everything done to save people ?
"
p261_270,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p261_271,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p261_272,"Is it in the right place ?
"
p261_273,"Did he trip ?
"
p261_274,"He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
"
p261_275,"I was ready for this.
"
p261_276,"They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
"
p261_277,"Blair is very positive at European Councils.
"
p261_278,"They are interior designers and architects.
"
p261_279,"That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
"
p261_280,"The Scotch whisky industry is absent from the agenda.
"
p261_281,"The offer will run for the next three weekends.
"
p261_282,"At first I thought I was gone.
"
p261_283,"I am just trying to do my job.
"
p261_284,"The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
"
p261_285,"We're trying to get rounded performers.
"
p261_286,"They can leave at any time.
"
p261_287,"It has the potential to be another North Sea.
"
p261_288,"It would be a tragedy if it had to close.
"
p261_289,"He has not created a Festival resource.
"
p261_290,"Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
"
p261_291,"He has run a hell of a race.
"
p261_292,"It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
"
p261_293,"He was also married with two children.
"
p261_294,"It was an easy decision to come here.
"
p261_295,"On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
"
p261_296,"It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
"
p261_297,"He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
"
p261_298,"A senior party insider said.
"
p261_299,"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
"
p261_300,"She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
"
p261_301,"This will help our confidence.
"
p261_302,"The two companies were not for sale.
"
p261_303,"Her appeal is to be heard this week.
"
p261_304,"In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
"
p261_305,"The cause of the accident remained unclear.
"
p261_306,"The partnership was set up during the summer.
"
p261_307,"It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
"
p261_308,"Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
"
p261_309,"We will deliver at director level.
"
p261_310,"Size is not the issue.
"
p261_311,"He will address the nation this evening.
"
p261_312,"They have shown a great desire and attitude.
"
p261_313,"Tony Blair said as little.
"
p261_314,"His was a huge success story.
"
p261_315,"We would hope to make progress on that next year.
"
p261_316,"That is the general feeling.
"
p261_317,"Holland won by five wickets.
"
p261_318,"He was obviously very genuine.
"
p261_319,"The casting is as perfect.
"
p261_320,"It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
"
p261_321,"A Home Office spokesman said.
"
p261_322,"Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
"
p261_323,"If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
"
p261_324,"This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
"
p261_325,"Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
"
p261_326,"It is a potential danger.
"
p261_327,"Cast Away now on general release.
"
p261_328,"That could bring the peace process to a standstill.
"
p261_329,"The City welcomed the numbers.
"
p261_330,"You will never get a conviction.
"
p261_331,"The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
"
p261_332,"That meant the search was unlawful.
"
p261_333,"They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
"
p261_334,"There will be good prospects ahead.
"
p261_335,"I would do away with the dress code.
"
p261_336,"However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
"
p261_337,"There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
"
p261_338,"Both sides have been hit by injury.
"
p261_339,"What form did that take ?
"
p261_340,"Are they free ?
"
p261_341,"What are they for ?
"
p261_342,"Is there a waiting list ?
"
p261_343,"Do they think anyone else wants them ?
"
p261_344,"So what happens next ?
"
p261_345,"This ruling is a farce.
"
p261_346,"Both men were on one-year contracts.
"
p261_347,"However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
"
p261_348,"The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
"
p261_349,"The Premier League has been a huge success.
"
p261_350,"Thousands of British tourists were trapped in their hotels.
"
p261_351,"The whole family was in shock.
"
p261_352,"Public opinion was split on the proposal.
"
p261_353,"The election is total confusion and chaos.
"
p261_354,"It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
"
p261_355,"To beat the European champion is quite nice.
"
p261_356,"I've got a sense of humour, too.
"
p261_357,"Her life is now back on track.
"
p261_358,"There was some merit in that.
"
p261_359,"That is a trend which will be encouraged.
"
p261_360,"It's too horrible to think.
"
p261_361,"They are now out in the cold.
"
p261_362,"At first, the youngster was not keen.
"
p261_363,"My view has now completely changed.
"
p261_364,"Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
"
p261_365,"He was then replaced by Ross.
"
p261_366,"He is not very big, either.
"
p261_367,"Finally came the moment of truth.
"
p261_368,"Neither man has been charged.
"
p261_369,"Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
"
p261_370,"The idea was first mooted a year ago.
"
p261_371,"He did a good job.
"
p261_372,"Had this been common practice ?
"
p261_373,"What do they want us to do ?
"
p261_374,"Is it worth it ?
"
p261_375,"Does it matter ?
"
p261_376,"He took a draw on his cigarette.
"
p261_377,"I am a lucky man.
"
p261_378,"But they have taken the lesson to heart.
"
p261_379,"The Allies intend to maintain the average.
"
p261_380,"We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
"
p261_381,"You did not see it.
"
p261_382,"Alex Ferguson is the same.
"
p261_383,"They should take their mobile phones.
"
p261_384,"We regret that they were brought in the first place.
"
p261_385,"From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
"
p261_386,"On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
"
p261_387,"However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
"
p261_388,"He must have seen the movie.
"
p261_389,"We must put a marker down.
"
p261_390,"The result is called a patent.
"
p261_391,"It's as wide as a church in here.
"
p261_392,"This remains the party's policy.
"
p261_393,"The pair are very much in love.
"
p261_394,"I am a good player.
"
p261_395,"You have to rely on each other.
"
p261_396,"However, it was well worth the wait.
"
p261_397,"No other job in world football can compare to this one.
"
p261_398,"I wanted to go out on a high.
"
p261_399,"I felt the head was very like me.
"
p261_400,"It was fit for royalty.
"
p261_401,"The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
"
p261_402,"We operate as a Scottish company.
"
p261_403,"How do you take them away ?
"
p261_404,"However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
"
p261_405,"After the match, do you ?
"
p261_406,"He has been in a nursing home for two years.
"
p261_407,"He put some colour into Scottish history.
"
p261_408,"This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
"
p261_409,"It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
"
p261_410,"Motion described it as a unique event.
"
p261_411,"I had a fortunate war.
"
p261_412,"The breakdown was much later in her life.
"
p261_413,"I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
"
p261_414,"It is good for Europe.
"
p261_415,"It does not even have a staff shortage.
"
p261_416,"However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
"
p261_417,"Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
"
p261_418,"Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
"
p261_419,"But a surprise is in store.
"
p261_420,"Smoking is also very important.
"
p261_421,"The second goal was superb.
"
p261_422,"We're delighted about the vote.
"
p261_423,"The case will now go to appeal.
"
p261_424,"This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
"
p261_425,"Yet the data is compelling.
"
p261_426,"It was important to win the singles.
"
p261_427,"He's had to suffer for the last six years.
"
p261_428,"The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
"
p261_429,"He was on a horse.
"
p261_430,"Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
"
p261_431,"That's the way it works.
"
p261_432,"The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
"
p261_433,"It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
"
p261_434,"Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
"
p261_435,"He is on the wrong side.
"
p261_436,"By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
"
p261_437,"It was the climax of the thing.
"
p261_438,"The trial will open today.
"
p261_439,"I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
"
p261_440,"It will make a huge difference.
"
p261_441,"It is an absolute nonsense.
"
p261_442,"Everything in golf is a balance.
"
p261_443,"It is a case of pity for us.
"
p261_444,"Gordon is also highly rated.
"
p261_445,"The first game is so important.
"
p261_446,"It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
"
p261_447,"And we might go back.
"
p261_448,"We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
"
p261_449,"He deserves a second chance.
"
p261_450,"You have to see the work.
"
p261_451,"The funding is now there.
"
p261_452,"But we have built a platform for next season.
"
p261_453,"I was embarrassed by it.
"
p261_454,"I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
"
p261_455,"First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
"
p261_456,"Paris is not only young.
"
p261_457,"No one wants to go through these things.
"
p261_458,"Our legal advice is clear.
"
p261_459,"It all began as an accident.
"
p261_460,"Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
"
p261_461,"It might be useful to have something in black and white.
"
p261_462,"They were totally behind it.
"
p261_463,"Let that be their memorial.
"
p261_464,"Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
"
p261_465,"She would take the Farmer to the opera.
"
p261_466,"The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
"
p261_467,"Phil Mickelson did that last year.
"
p261_468,"No options are excluded at all.
"
p261_469,"They are defined by law.
"
p261_470,"If that's the case, he will struggle.
"
p261_471,"I'm very pleased for the club and for myself.
"
p261_472,"It's been a long, long journey.
"
p261_473,"War is not the action.
"
p261_474,"My place is in the kitchen.
"
