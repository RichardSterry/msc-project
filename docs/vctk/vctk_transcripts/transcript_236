p236_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p236_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p236_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p236_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p236_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p236_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p236_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p236_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p236_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p236_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p236_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p236_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p236_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p236_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p236_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p236_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p236_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p236_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p236_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p236_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p236_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p236_025,"A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
"
p236_026,"In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
"
p236_027,"Meetings will also remain private.
"
p236_028,"Because we do not need it.
"
p236_029,"It's going to have a hell of an effect.
"
p236_030,"And we have a singer.
"
p236_031,"He was jailed for four years.
"
p236_032,"He should emerge as the winner.
"
p236_033,"This is a central issue.
"
p236_034,"He works at the airport.
"
p236_035,"It is not for any other purpose.
"
p236_036,"If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
"
p236_037,"It carried a double message.
"
p236_038,"That means an extra two years.
"
p236_039,"That was the case with David.
"
p236_040,"The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
"
p236_041,"I needed a change, a new challenge.
"
p236_042,"Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
"
p236_043,"Their campaign is in disarray.
"
p236_044,"But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
"
p236_045,"We are working on it.
"
p236_046,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p236_047,"Everything else is a bonus.
"
p236_048,"Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
"
p236_049,"This is the interesting part.
"
p236_050,"I haven't been ill at all.
"
p236_051,"They just thought it was extremely good acting.
"
p236_052,"That was the difference today.
"
p236_053,"We keep an eye on it.
"
p236_054,"The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
"
p236_055,"We felt it was sufficient.
"
p236_056,"You must have a government and a good civil service.
"
p236_057,"Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
"
p236_058,"You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
"
p236_059,"But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
"
p236_060,"I have proved that in the past.
"
p236_061,"The tournament has now been cancelled.
"
p236_062,"I was very pleased with them today, though.
"
p236_063,"I was as strong as a horse.
"
p236_064,"Then followed a bout of flu.
"
p236_065,"The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
"
p236_066,"Both men were on one-year contracts.
"
p236_068,"Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
"
p236_069,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p236_070,"He was seen as the enemy.
"
p236_071,"It looks like a hit.
"
p236_072,"These people are not big names.
"
p236_073,"This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
"
p236_074,"We did it for the jersey.
"
p236_075,"The Festival is prepared to help.
"
p236_076,"Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
"
p236_077,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p236_078,"He was just a journalist.
"
p236_079,"On Saturday, it was much the same.
"
p236_080,"They lived for their children.
"
p236_081,"We have turned the corner.
"
p236_083,"The Queen Mother is dead.
"
p236_084,"However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.
"
p236_085,"Change will however have to be in euros.
"
p236_086,"It was a big departure.
"
p236_087,"Does it matter ?
"
p236_088,"How do you take them away ?
"
p236_089,"However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
"
p236_090,"After the match, do you ?
"
p236_091,"The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
"
p236_092,"The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
"
p236_093,"It is open season on the Old Firm.
"
p236_094,"The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
"
p236_095,"I had a ball today.
"
p236_096,"He refused to name the survivors.
"
p236_097,"That time is not now, however.
"
p236_098,"We created so many chances.
"
p236_099,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p236_100,"Our house was very small.
"
p236_101,"It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
"
p236_102,"It became difficult for me.
"
p236_103,"It's not a lack of effort.
"
p236_104,"It is a total and utter change of culture.
"
p236_105,"He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
"
p236_107,"They will notice a difference.
"
p236_108,"Football is a passion for many.
"
p236_109,"New Year will be very busy.
"
p236_110,"There's still plenty time left.
"
p236_111,"The result is a vacuum.
"
p236_112,"I've heard this stuff about the markets.
"
p236_113,"You can spend money on housing.
"
p236_114,"The hearing was due to continue today.
"
p236_115,"I can't even get into the A team.
"
p236_116,"In addition, investor choice is reduced.
"
p236_117,"But his attendance is not guaranteed.
"
p236_118,"Three hours later, the man was free.
"
p236_119,"Which can happen any time.
"
p236_120,"The colours are very pretty.
"
p236_121,"He is a lovely man.
"
p236_122,"Becoming a father was wonderful.
"
p236_123,"I was on a roll.
"
p236_124,"The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
"
p236_125,"Something will be done by corporate bodies.
"
p236_126,"He said to give a local injection.
"
p236_127,"They made such decisions in London.
"
p236_128,"You are a gambling man.
"
p236_129,"Before it was an ordeal.
"
p236_130,"I love the spectacle of cinema.
"
p236_131,"We will try to find someone.
"
p236_132,"They could use a boost.
"
p236_133,"She died at her home.
"
p236_134,"I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
"
p236_135,"I enjoy the creative process.
"
p236_136,"But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
"
p236_137,"Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
"
p236_138,"It was a piece of art.
"
p236_139,"That view has not altered.
"
p236_140,"It's all change at Kilmarnock.
"
p236_141,"So I got a blood test.
"
p236_142,"It has become a way of life.
"
p236_143,"The whole industry is a shambles.
"
p236_144,"Like the others, he was arrested.
"
p236_145,"We will provide immediate access.
"
p236_146,"He could do nothing about it.
"
p236_147,"We have a clean bill of health.
"
p236_148,"Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
"
p236_149,"I was shaking on the blocks.
"
p236_151,"It was by the numbers.
"
p236_152,"It would seem a natural progression.
"
p236_153,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p236_154,"This action reflects a slump in bookings.
"
p236_155,"Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
"
p236_156,"It was a funny feeling.
"
p236_157,"I'm afraid to say anything.
"
p236_158,"We did what we had to do.
"
p236_159,"It's not like us.
"
p236_161,"It is not a financial issue.
"
p236_162,"I have got a wife to feed.
"
p236_163,"Seven people were later detained by police.
"
p236_164,"The striker needed attention before he could resume.
"
p236_165,"We have a budget in March.
"
p236_166,"He is not a team captain.
"
p236_167,"Greenwood said he was happy with that.
"
p236_168,"Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
"
p236_169,"It opens the door to the Champions League.
"
p236_170,"That is not the case.
"
p236_172,"It's nice to be nice.
"
p236_173,"They could not match it.
"
p236_174,"Are they free ?
"
p236_175,"What are they for ?
"
p236_176,"Is there a waiting list ?
"
p236_177,"Do they think anyone else wants them ?
"
p236_178,"So what happens next ?
"
p236_179,"Had this been common practice ?
"
p236_180,"What do they want us to do ?
"
p236_181,"At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
"
p236_182,"One season, they might do well.
"
p236_183,"I feel like my game has come a long way.
"
p236_184,"The Hibs manager is no fool.
"
p236_185,"It is not either national standards or local control.
"
p236_186,"City sentiment is in his favour.
"
p236_187,"The hotel was now for sale.
"
p236_188,"We are the gateway to justice.
"
p236_189,"Tomorrow is a new day.
"
p236_190,"It makes no influence on the public.
"
p236_191,"Each case is treated on merit.
"
p236_192,"I have spoken to head office.
"
p236_193,"Says the Duke of York.
"
p236_194,"I had too much to drink.
"
p236_195,"As many as the market will support.
"
p236_196,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p236_197,"That is a waste of energy.
"
p236_198,"The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
"
p236_199,"It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.
"
p236_200,"I had a train to catch.
"
p236_201,"It shows the strength of the roots.
"
p236_202,"However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
"
p236_203,"This youngster is so exciting!
"
p236_204,"We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
"
p236_205,"It caused a lot of upset.
"
p236_206,"Motorists will buy passes in advance.
"
p236_207,"My duty is to win.
"
p236_208,"Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
"
p236_209,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p236_210,"No details of the talks were given.
"
p236_211,"This will be our new beginning.
"
p236_212,"They have the cash and the fire power.
"
p236_213,"The service from the other players was super.
"
p236_214,"The early physical reports were clear.
"
p236_215,"Tommy is not a problem.
"
p236_216,"The sanctions are about collective punishment.
"
p236_217,"John Daly has a burning ambition.
"
p236_218,"A deadline is still essential.
"
p236_219,"You have caught a serial killer.
"
p236_220,"You are a great player.
"
p236_221,"I won't make an official complaint.
"
p236_222,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p236_223,"They are looking at a flotation.
"
p236_224,"Which isn't a bad idea.
"
p236_225,"There is no quick fix.
"
p236_226,"There was a lot of resentment.
"
p236_227,"That might help a bit.
"
p236_228,"From there, they can go anywhere.
"
p236_229,"Death is outside the language.
"
p236_230,"I had relied on him.
"
p236_231,"The course has helped a lot.
"
p236_232,"I'm just a regular person.
"
p236_233,"It had all been arranged.
"
p236_234,"His third goal was superb.
"
p236_235,"Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
"
p236_236,"I am considered a teenager.
"
p236_237,"Anyway, the job will be part-time.
"
p236_238,"This will secure the future of our industry.
"
p236_239,"For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
"
p236_240,"People should make their own decisions.
"
p236_241,"They said that they stood by their statement.
"
p236_242,"You have to do your research.
"
p236_243,"We played them off the pitch.
"
p236_244,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p236_245,"Truth is the child of time.
"
p236_246,"And they were being paid ?
"
p236_247,"Was everything done to save people ?
"
p236_249,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p236_250,"That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
"
p236_251,"A small number of new jobs will also be created.
"
p236_252,"It's important to get it right.
"
p236_253,"Pensions are a long-term investment.
"
p236_254,"Those overseas offices were great.
"
p236_255,"On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
"
p236_256,"Half of young people had had contact with the police.
"
p236_257,"I was just a kid.
"
p236_258,"He was good, but not that good.
"
p236_259,"It was quite a new prescription.
"
p236_260,"It is very hard for her.
"
p236_261,"He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
"
p236_262,"It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
"
p236_263,"We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
"
p236_264,"Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
"
p236_265,"You can feel at home in China.
"
p236_266,"Either way, the investor retains the premium.
"
p236_267,"The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
"
p236_268,"Washington is consumed by the crisis.
"
p236_269,"Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
"
p236_270,"But they were never expected to last.
"
p236_271,"However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
"
p236_272,"The capital costs are modest.
"
p236_273,"I told you I was ill.
"
p236_274,"He will go on the bench.
"
p236_275,"That could be in place by next year.
"
p236_276,"We accept the new rules.
"
p236_277,"We run within the law.
"
p236_278,"We have the moral high ground.
"
p236_279,"He took over our lives.
"
p236_280,"It has all been done in secret.
"
p236_281,"They must play for each other.
"
p236_282,"Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
"
p236_283,"She always wanted her own way.
"
p236_284,"I realised I was lucky to have it.
"
p236_285,"They can leave at any time.
"
p236_286,"Much of the equipment was new.
"
p236_287,"Blair also had a penalty.
"
p236_288,"Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
"
p236_289,"Frankly, we should all have such problems.
"
p236_290,"It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
"
p236_291,"My body is a wreck.
"
p236_292,"She failed in her action.
"
p236_293,"Stephen will get his first cap.
"
p236_294,"The partnership was set up during the summer.
"
p236_295,"And that match was played in June.
"
p236_296,"I saw it at a ruck.
"
p236_297,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p236_298,"Does the name matter ?
"
p236_299,"how do you get it back ?
"
p236_300,"What are you not good at ?
"
p236_301,"I think, therefore I am ?
"
p236_302,"It's all designed to speed up the service.
"
p236_303,"Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
"
p236_304,"He will address the nation this evening.
"
p236_305,"They have shown a great desire and attitude.
"
p236_306,"Maloney is an engaging talent.
"
p236_307,"The rescue package is public money.
"
p236_308,"I was there five months ago.
"
p236_309,"I am a retailer by nature.
"
p236_310,"His job was not advertised.
"
p236_311,"We can work all night.
"
p236_312,"It was really very frightening.
"
p236_313,"It was an excellent performance.
"
p236_314,"The answer is with ourselves.
"
p236_315,"And we can do it.
"
p236_316,"These figures are truly awful.
"
p236_317,"That is the real test.
"
p236_318,"They have to be addressed.
"
p236_319,"It aims to produce its report before Christmas.
"
p236_320,"Cast Away now on general release.
"
p236_321,"All winners should be tested.
"
p236_322,"I can live with it.
"
p236_323,"A lot has been written.
"
p236_324,"And he goes with it.
"
p236_325,"The law will take its course.
"
p236_326,"This is a historic occasion.
"
p236_327,"This ruling is a farce.
"
p236_328,"After some discussion they did.
"
p236_329,"I am not obsessed with sex.
"
p236_330,"I didn't have the reply.
"
p236_331,"Public opinion was split on the proposal.
"
p236_332,"These days will be back.
"
p236_333,"You may have a short memory.
"
p236_335,"There was no time scale.
"
p236_336,"That decision has already been made.
"
p236_337,"In his absence, the council adopted the change.
"
p236_338,"The game is now open.
"
p236_339,"The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
"
p236_340,"Even the one she loved.
"
p236_341,"Finally, he paid for the movie.
"
p236_342,"It was almost too much.
"
p236_343,"Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
"
p236_344,"The idea was first mooted a year ago.
"
p236_345,"Three years ago he would have been.
"
p236_346,"It's a policy which has worked for us.
"
p236_347,"We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
"
p236_348,"The confidence isn't there now.
"
p236_349,"We put our bid in last night.
"
p236_350,"A great deal has been achieved.
"
p236_351,"He had no previous convictions.
"
p236_352,"Alex Ferguson is the same.
"
p236_353,"What do we do ?
"
p236_354,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p236_355,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p236_356,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p236_357,"George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
"
p236_358,"Like his acting, it was an accident.
"
p236_359,"Scotland is the home of golf.
"
p236_360,"They have broken that promise.
"
p236_361,"From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
"
p236_362,"It's only a matter of scale.
"
p236_363,"We must put a marker down.
"
p236_364,"She said they would appeal.
"
p236_365,"There is no deal as yet.
"
p236_366,"It's as wide as a church in here.
"
p236_367,"The work with Alison was a great experience.
"
p236_368,"It was like a weekly wage.
"
p236_369,"We are a Scottish company.
"
p236_370,"They will fight for everything.
"
p236_371,"The pair are very much in love.
"
p236_372,"We used to keep our business rates.
"
