p285_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p285_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p285_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p285_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p285_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p285_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p285_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p285_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p285_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p285_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p285_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p285_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p285_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p285_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p285_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p285_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p285_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p285_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p285_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p285_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p285_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p285_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p285_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p285_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p285_025,"Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
"
p285_026,"In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
"
p285_027,"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
"
p285_028,"However, the following year the cancer returned.
"
p285_029,"Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
"
p285_030,"They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
"
p285_031,"There's a story, too.
"
p285_032,"This is the window.
"
p285_033,"He was jailed for five years.
"
p285_034,"Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
"
p285_035,"They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
"
p285_036,"It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
"
p285_037,"They're just different.
"
p285_038,"It was clear.
"
p285_039,"Indeed, he does.
"
p285_040,"People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
"
p285_041,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p285_042,"Sure, it's funny.
"
p285_043,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p285_044,"Is a drug dealer?
"
p285_045,"He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
"
p285_046,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p285_047,"No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
"
p285_048,"Here's a clue.
"
p285_049,"I was lost.
"
p285_050,"It's a miracle.
"
p285_051,"I love the Dome.
"
p285_052,"There was no safety net.
"
p285_053,"This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
"
p285_054,"That's the truth.
"
p285_055,"We will treat it like a World Cup match.
"
p285_056,"The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
"
p285_057,"Scotland had great assets.
"
p285_058,"It's that kind of place.
"
p285_059,"They are real.
"
p285_060,"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
"
p285_061,"We should have known.
"
p285_062,"I was conceived in Aberdeen.
"
p285_063,"Robin Williams is very subdued.
"
p285_064,"The tournament has now been cancelled.
"
p285_065,"There could be a way back.
"
p285_066,"The death rates are still as high.
"
p285_067,"I had my suspicions.
"
p285_068,"I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
"
p285_069,"I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
"
p285_070,"Even the one she loved.
"
p285_071,"It's now down in black and white.
"
p285_072,"Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
"
p285_073,"What has changed?
"
p285_074,"Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
"
p285_075,"He is in the queue.
"
p285_076,"He is driven.
"
p285_077,"All options are open.
"
p285_078,"I was too young.
"
p285_079,"Someone who cares
"
p285_080,"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
"
p285_081,"It is a blow.
"
p285_082,"They lived for their children.
"
p285_083,"It will be tight.
"
p285_084,"This is the start of our season.
"
p285_085,"Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
"
p285_086,"That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
"
p285_087,"We knew they could do it.
"
p285_088,"But I was wrong.
"
p285_089,"Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
"
p285_090,"I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
"
p285_091,"I saw the whole thing.
"
p285_092,"Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
"
p285_093,"It was mayhem.
"
p285_094,"Journalists should make him.
"
p285_095,"It is a love affair.
"
p285_096,"However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
"
p285_097,"They tried to deny it.
"
p285_098,"After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
"
p285_099,"No, the equipment is extra.
"
p285_100,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p285_101,"Oil embargo endorsed.
"
p285_102,"For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
"
p285_103,"She reflects a bit.
"
p285_104,"It was an interesting thing to do.
"
p285_105,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p285_106,"She is believed to be in South Africa.
"
p285_107,"I was fighting for my life, I thought.
"
p285_108,"Is that right?
"
p285_109,"He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
"
p285_110,"It was the eighties.
"
p285_111,"This gives a financial incentive to switch.
"
p285_112,"It is so sad.
"
p285_113,"Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
"
p285_114,"In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
"
p285_115,"It is rubbish.
"
p285_116,"Who would be a referee?
"
p285_117,"We enjoyed it today.
"
p285_118,"She does not want to speak.
"
p285_119,"Here, again, they were denied a voice.
"
p285_120,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p285_121,"It has removed a bit of guilt.
"
p285_122,"She really suffered for her art.
"
p285_123,"It is not a U-turn.
"
p285_124,"Offered the gold medal, he declined.
"
p285_125,"No production was achieved.
"
p285_126,"He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
"
p285_127,"I am now unemployed.
"
p285_128,"We work well together.
"
p285_129,"It's not true.
"
p285_130,"Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
"
p285_131,"Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
"
p285_132,"It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
"
p285_133,"He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
"
p285_134,"If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
"
p285_135,"It seems so long since I did the exams.
"
p285_136,"Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
"
p285_137,"We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
"
p285_138,"Who would be right?
"
p285_139,"Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
"
p285_140,"I was awful.
"
p285_141,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p285_142,"Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
"
p285_143,"IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
"
p285_144,"The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
"
p285_145,"The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
"
p285_146,"The weather forecast isn't good.
"
p285_147,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p285_148,"I was on a roll.
"
p285_149,"She had gone to the Catholic school.
"
p285_150,"We are on a four-year mission.
"
p285_151,"The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
"
p285_152,"It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
"
p285_153,"My Dad is a hero.
"
p285_154,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p285_155,"Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
"
p285_156,"That includes the equipment?
"
p285_157,"Well, he should know.
"
p285_158,"I will tell you.
"
p285_159,"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
"
p285_160,"Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
"
p285_161,"As, indeed, they would be.
"
p285_162,"The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
"
p285_163,"Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
"
p285_164,"They are not advertised.
"
p285_165,"Tell it like it was?
"
p285_166,"Seven people were later detained by police.
"
p285_167,"It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
"
p285_168,"By then, however, both men were already in the US.
"
p285_169,"I carried on for him.
"
p285_170,"He was a crazy man.
"
p285_171,"They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
"
p285_172,"One season, they might do well.
"
p285_173,"As we worked.
"
p285_174,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p285_175,"It is not either national standards or local control.
"
p285_176,"My players are special.
"
p285_177,"I drove the ball well.
"
p285_178,"The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
"
p285_179,"The goals were good.
"
p285_180,"His name was unknown.
"
p285_181,"Nothing is safe.
"
p285_182,"And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
"
p285_183,"Many innocent people will die.
"
p285_184,"It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
"
p285_185,"I saw military vehicles in the distance.
"
p285_186,"The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
"
p285_187,"What has caused the demise of singing?
"
p285_188,"Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
"
p285_189,"There is no openness.
"
p285_190,"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
"
p285_191,"Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
"
p285_192,"It caused a lot of upset.
"
p285_193,"I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
"
p285_194,"It's a fact.
"
p285_195,"I came home by ambulance.
"
p285_196,"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
"
p285_197,"We live by the rule of law.
"
p285_198,"The service from the other players was super.
"
p285_199,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p285_200,"They've got three-quarters of the way.
"
p285_201,"Today was first class.
"
p285_202,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p285_203,"I don't want to use it.
"
p285_204,"There was an e-mail.
"
p285_205,"He knows a lot.
"
p285_206,"Twaddle is a case in point.
"
p285_207,"It's not before time.
"
p285_208,"It's not ideal.
"
p285_209,"We want to keep the pound.
"
p285_210,"In each case they were a goal down.
"
p285_211,"However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
"
p285_212,"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
"
p285_213,"The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
"
p285_214,"People should make their own decisions.
"
p285_215,"The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
"
p285_216,"Because they didn't want to know.
"
p285_217,"That has been the easy part.
"
p285_218,"He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
"
p285_219,"At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
"
p285_220,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p285_221,"I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
"
p285_222,"Clearly, the stakes are high.
"
p285_223,"It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
"
p285_224,"He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
"
p285_225,"But she was.
"
p285_226,"At the time, he was a living legend.
"
p285_227,"My wife and family are the support system.
"
p285_228,"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
"
p285_229,"Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
"
p285_230,"They tried to give her advice.
"
p285_231,"The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
"
p285_232,"Half of young people had had contact with the police.
"
p285_233,"Wealth is relative.
"
p285_234,"You should be.
"
p285_235,"It's quite nice.
"
p285_236,"Three weeks later, he resigned.
"
p285_237,"It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
"
p285_238,"The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
"
p285_239,"He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
"
p285_240,"In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
"
p285_241,"If we lose the doctor it would be the last straw.
"
p285_242,"We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
"
p285_243,"I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
"
p285_244,"I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
"
p285_245,"In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
"
p285_246,"We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
"
p285_247,"Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
"
p285_248,"It was a hit.
"
p285_249,"There's the mix.
"
p285_250,"Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
"
p285_251,"The concerns are the same.
"
p285_252,"He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
"
p285_253,"For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
"
p285_254,"It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
"
p285_255,"It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
"
p285_256,"One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
"
p285_257,"Is that a serious question?
"
p285_258,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p285_259,"However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
"
p285_260,"There's not much money in cycling.
"
p285_261,"Souter will be back.
"
p285_262,"In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
"
p285_263,"Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
"
p285_264,"He was also married with two children.
"
p285_265,"The system can work.
"
p285_266,"We are happy.
"
p285_267,"It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
"
p285_268,"We're in shock.
"
p285_269,"Of course I was tempted.
"
p285_270,"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
"
p285_271,"It was very fast.
"
p285_272,"He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
"
p285_273,"They seem to get away with it.
"
p285_274,"I feel pretty good.
"
p285_275,"The election is total confusion and chaos.
"
p285_276,"She looked so young.
"
p285_277,"It's so awful.
"
p285_278,"He looked very sharp.
"
p285_279,"Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
"
p285_280,"What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
"
p285_281,"He will address the nation this evening.
"
p285_282,"Yet, it worked.
"
p285_283,"Who will perform?
"
p285_284,"It was good.
"
p285_285,"Who did the recruiting?
"
p285_286,"We are not going to forget.
"
p285_287,"No Briton has ever won.
"
p285_288,"He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
"
p285_289,"Who can predict?
"
p285_290,"There was a vacuum.
"
p285_291,"I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
"
p285_292,"He was at home with his pals.
"
p285_293,"What has altered?
"
p285_294,"I was brought up in a mining background.
"
p285_295,"She is really magic.
"
p285_296,"Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
"
p285_297,"One was a lawyer.
"
p285_298,"A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
"
p285_299,"They are wrong.
"
p285_300,"It could work.
"
p285_301,"This is a war over our home.
"
p285_302,"In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
"
p285_303,"Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
"
p285_304,"It needs a team approach.
"
p285_305,"The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
"
p285_306,"There is no excuse.
"
p285_307,"However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
"
p285_308,"The letters are going out today.
"
p285_309,"She is very distinctive.
"
p285_310,"We are a peaceful people.
"
p285_311,"Hartley should know.
"
p285_312,"Henman has been warned.
"
p285_313,"Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
"
p285_314,"Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
"
p285_315,"A review is under way.
"
p285_316,"It will work.
"
p285_317,"I came into this world with nothing.
"
p285_318,"That is a trend which will be encouraged.
"
p285_319,"Off with their heads.
"
p285_320,"We think all other measures are not exhausted.
"
p285_321,"There was no time scale.
"
p285_322,"Our message was inclusive.
"
p285_323,"Either team will be hard.
"
p285_324,"It's not long enough.
"
p285_325,"Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
"
p285_326,"He scored a touchdown.
"
p285_327,"The party is up for it.
"
p285_328,"The outcome is not in doubt.
"
p285_329,"Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
"
p285_330,"In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
"
p285_331,"The same things will happen with GM foods.
"
p285_332,"Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
"
p285_333,"Three years ago he would have been.
"
p285_334,"I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
"
p285_335,"Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
"
p285_336,"I've got no secret.
"
p285_337,"went on sale.
"
p285_338,"I'm very lucky.
"
p285_339,"Our policy is clear.
"
p285_340,"In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
"
p285_341,"I will miss him.
"
p285_342,"They should take their mobile phones.
"
p285_343,"I got a yellow card.
"
p285_344,"From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
"
p285_345,"The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
"
p285_346,"I HAVE a dream.
"
p285_347,"There may be reasons for it.
"
p285_348,"Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
"
p285_349,"Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
"
p285_350,"A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
"
