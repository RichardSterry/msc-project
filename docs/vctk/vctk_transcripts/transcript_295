p295_001,Please call Stella.
p295_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p295_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p295_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p295_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p295_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p295_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p295_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p295_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p295_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p295_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p295_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p295_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p295_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p295_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p295_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p295_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p295_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p295_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p295_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p295_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p295_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p295_025,It has never been worthwhile.
p295_026,She was on the edge of breaking point.
p295_027,"However, the following year the cancer returned."
p295_028,Because we do not need it.
p295_029,It has been supremely successful.
p295_030,"He's a good player, but he's not the only one."
p295_031,Which is where the manager comes in.
p295_032,"Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often."
p295_033,Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p295_034,We thought we would never see them again.
p295_035,"After that, it's a step into the unknown."
p295_036,She asked me for the appointment with me.
p295_037,He must not be removed from office.
p295_038,That means an extra two years.
p295_039,I think he was nervous to begin with.
p295_040,Our children are the future of our society.
p295_041,I'm sure he would love it.
p295_042,A final agreement has not yet been completed.
p295_043,It's just not our biggest problem.
p295_044,It is just like any other club.
p295_045,Everything is possible in football.
p295_046,I'm sure he didn't mean it.
p295_048,We are going to New Broomfield to win.
p295_049,Colin is free to speak with other teams.
p295_050,He declined to give further details.
p295_051,I think it was entirely the right decision.
p295_052,Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p295_053,For sure we want to win it.
p295_054,"There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!"

p295_063,They have a car and cannot afford another.
p295_064,"It is, after all, a very funny play."
p295_065,Can you imagine a world without design?
p295_066,"I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier."
p295_067,And he listens to his artists as well.
p295_068,I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
p295_069,SO now we know the secret.
p295_070,He's right up to a point.
p295_071,We would have looked out for each other.
p295_072,I had no choice but to leave.
p295_073,Where does he go from here?
p295_074,Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p295_075,"This time, there were no such rewards."
p295_076,But then they scored their fourth.

p295_078,But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

p295_085,"However, we have not come to any conclusions."
p295_086,There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p295_087,I don't entirely buy that.
p295_088,We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
p295_089,It is giving out the wrong message.
p295_090,It didn't come as any great surprise.
p295_091,"For these people, the ruling is very welcome."
p295_092,"As a nation, we must become more active."
p295_093,Nothing has changed from the season before.
p295_094,I'm not thinking too much about the tour.
p295_095,I had some time with Aston Villa.
p295_096,We recognise it as a key area.
p295_097,The mood was euphoric.
p295_098,The time of judgment has arrived.
p295_099,"Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea."

p295_111,She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p295_112,It is reform in return for resources.
p295_113,It offers a different viewpoint.
p295_114,"The band was good, and it's been a great day."
p295_115,I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p295_116,I have no plans to retire.
p295_117,"The Scots are, however, in good company."
p295_118,"Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray."
p295_119,There were far more pressing matters to consider.

p295_122,They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.

p295_126,You have a very persuasive president.
p295_127,"Sure, we have problems."

p295_130,"Five years later, the deception continued."

p295_141,"I got very, very tired."
p295_142,What did you learn in school today?
p295_143,He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
p295_144,It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p295_145,He's working hard on that right now.
p295_146,The jury is still out.
p295_147,Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p295_148,"At the moment, the success in Germany is good."
p295_149,I can't say that this is very usual.
p295_150,We opened up and everything was gone.

p295_166,He is willing to pay the required amount.
p295_167,These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p295_168,He should emerge as the winner.
p295_169,That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
p295_170,We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p295_171,The story was being repeated across Scotland.
p295_172,You're not going to forget something like that.

p295_192,They tried to give her advice.
p295_193,"If we live forever, can we really be said to live?"
p295_194,Defeat is simply not an option.

p295_196,Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.

p295_198,At least two women were among those arrested.
p295_199,My intentions are to go on like this.
p295_200,It is not attempting to offer a solution.
p295_201,She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p295_202,I will be having talks with the workforce.
p295_203,It's like an extension of your body.
p295_204,That's why he is a national treasure.
p295_205,It seems a waste of talents.
p295_206,Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p295_207,That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p295_208,Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p295_209,We need to know more about her.
p295_210,And what is she escaping from?
p295_211,Leaving the Labour Party is one thing.
p295_212,The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p295_213,He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p295_214,What happened in this instance is serious misconduct.
p295_215,The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p295_216,I don't know how they make the weight.
p295_217,"That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective."
p295_218,She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p295_219,"I'm very tired, but it was worth it."
p295_220,The joint bid is still on course.
p295_221,This is the best moment of my career.
p295_222,My life has been turned upside down.
p295_224,Why is he not fighting for the Union?
p295_225,Parole is a decision for me.
p295_226,It left me with a sadness.
p295_227,We don't have any senior players.
p295_228,"Not so, it transpires."
p295_229,Knowledge is everything at this level.
p295_230,This will help our confidence.
p295_231,He has a wealth of experience.
p295_232,It is a very beautiful city.
p295_233,Her body was found on Monday morning.
p295_234,His father and mother are in film production.
p295_235,It's about attitudes to change.
p295_236,I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p295_237,We have seen the failure of politics.
p295_238,The party will make up its own mind.
p295_239,His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p295_240,I am very sorry to hear about this.
p295_241,"I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant."
p295_242,Hopefully we can put in a performance.
p295_243,When he came to see me on Monday.
p295_244,It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p295_245,Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p295_246,Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p295_247,"Next league matches, Dundee United - Motherwell."
p295_248,It became a book by itself.
p295_249,"Here, the fans have been fantastic."
p295_250,She was close to suicide at one stage.
p295_251,It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p295_252,What kind of festival is proposed?
p295_253,"In my experience, he does not do that."
p295_254,We're all involved in creating the work.
p295_255,When we started the album.
p295_256,We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p295_257,Controllers major concern is safety.
p295_258,This is your country.
p295_259,That's the most important thing for me.
p295_260,But it was the sensible thing to do.
p295_261,I think it'll be a great occasion.
p295_262,The committees are due to report next year.
p295_263,It was seriously unpleasant.
p295_264,What was the cause of all this outrage?
p295_265,"Now, she has completed a family tradition."
p295_266,The bombing has had a huge influence.
p295_267,"However, the groups denied the claims."
p295_268,This latter point is hugely important.
p295_269,The airport was even different.
p295_270,Whether this return was too soon.
p295_271,We're playing away from home and that's it.
p295_272,"It may be down, but New York is not out."
p295_273,"In fact, it was almost as if it was expected."
p295_274,"The overall effect is impressive, but distancing."
p295_275,My view has now completely changed.
p295_276,Manchester United are the classic example.
p295_277,I've never regretted my decision.
p295_278,"Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side."
p295_279,Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
p295_280,Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p295_281,Surely it can't get any worse.
p295_282,"He's in a lot of pain, it is very distressing."
p295_283,"We still have a long, long way to go."
p295_284,He preferred to concentrate on the positive.
p295_285,The Old Firm are going nowhere.
p295_286,I'm not sure.
p295_287,But the championship is not over yet.
p295_288,WE live in a world of large numbers.
p295_289,Agents and coaches must be paid.
p295_290,Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p295_291,Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p295_292,Anyone can still win this tournament.
p295_293,My husband was angry.
p295_294,You're going to die.
p295_295,We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p295_296,We're not really commenting on that.
p295_297,"John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say."
p295_298,Ferguson is not interested in the finances.
p295_299,Could they perhaps be related?
p295_300,It should be a condition of employment.
p295_301,It was not being marketed properly.
p295_302,"Sub Not Used, McCormick."
p295_303,They know their son was murdered.
p295_304,I love this tournament.
p295_305,Nobody will be forced to work.
p295_306,We're all going to take a holiday.
p295_307,It is good for Europe.
p295_308,This is your chance.
p295_309,They told him to go to drama school.
p295_310,"In order to get there, we have got to invest."
p295_311,It felt like my support system was leaving.
p295_312,The quality of life is difficult for them.
p295_313,I think they are right to be impatient.
p295_314,"But honestly, there is no need for us to panic."
p295_315,This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p295_316,The attack was totally out of the blue.
p295_317,It's a member of your family.
p295_318,It's an hour of the same response.
p295_319,There's a good chance of seeing something.
p295_320,"We were in different places, usually in cellars."
p295_321,Thirteen people will be made redundant.
p295_322,"This was the performance, and the result they needed."
p295_323,It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p295_324,It will not work in our favour.
p295_325,We're very close to making it in Europe.
p295_326,It was hugely popular decision.
p295_327,The decision was left entirely to him.
p295_328,"They have been contrasting years, certainly."
p295_329,These findings are vitally important.
p295_330,"That's always the case, isn't it?"
p295_331,I certainly think it should be there.
p295_332,I'm sure that they will learn.
p295_333,"His commitment, on the other hand, is clear."
p295_335,"If he could have prevented it happening, he would have."
p295_336,"This time, however, may have been different."
p295_337,We are well insured.
p295_338,"However, the second goal was about to be delivered."
p295_339,"However, that could alter following the latest case."
p295_340,It's like a garage.
p295_341,The last few weeks have been really bad.
p295_342,I believe in public services.
p295_343,The atmosphere is businesslike.
p295_344,But you can go beyond that condition.
p295_345,Genetic assessment is crucial.
p295_346,Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p295_347,Four years is a long time.
p295_348,This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p295_349,No one wants to go through these things.
p295_350,You'll get on like a house on fire.
p295_351,All inquiries should be made to the police.
p295_352,"Worse still, it can be infectious."
p295_353,They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
p295_354,"Nine days later, he suffered another attack."
p295_355,He is very much in our thoughts.
p295_356,So what could be better than becoming captain?
p295_357,Our Great Depression is our lives.
p295_358,He was elected as a councillor last year.
p295_359,You are always aware of the injury potential.
p295_360,But that is entirely a matter for them.
p295_361,But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p295_362,One Minister said the reports were bizarre.
p295_363,You're not going to get hurt.
p295_364,But no decision has been made.
p295_365,Our traditions and culture remain the same.
p295_366,I decided not to renew the contract.
p295_367,"For us, that decision was hard to understand."
p295_368,"Life, as many people know it, in other words."
p295_369,There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
p295_370,"I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes."
p295_371,She makes me feel very proud.
p295_372,He had been surprised by the local reaction.
p295_373,The voices told me to do it.
p295_374,I am a committed European.
p295_375,There is no point in looking any further.
p295_376,A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p295_377,I'm astonished by this decision.
p295_378,"General, You didn't get a modified."
p295_379,Surely the answer is yes.
p295_380,It's part of your life.
p295_381,"I could go on, but none of these things is true."
p295_382,That sort of thing is long gone.
p295_383,Our proposals are fully costed.
p295_384,We all started running forward.
p295_385,We did not want an absentee landlord.
p295_386,"That, however, is only part of the story."
p295_387,It worked well in Monaco.
p295_388,Things were not easy from the outset.
p295_389,The team is in division one in Spain.
p295_390,We don't even know his name.
p295_391,Our position is not a logic of war.
p295_392,I have played really well all year.
p295_393,"However, the referee was not in the giving vein."
p295_394,It was visibly on fire.
p295_395,It was a fiery game.
p295_396,This would give Scotland around eight members.
p295_397,That is European law.
p295_398,It was very lucky no-one was killed.
p295_399,What has caused the demise of singing?
p295_400,He's close friend of Gordon Brown.
p295_401,That is not a position they enjoy.
p295_402,Blair also had a penalty.
p295_403,We wanted to run away with her.
p295_404,"Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people."
p295_405,I am not retiring.
p295_406,I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p295_407,Boy is the town a mess.
p295_408,Barry will be able to handle this.
p295_409,It is a very disturbing picture for men.
p295_410,"To me, it was just a miracle."
