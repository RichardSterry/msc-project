p226_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p226_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p226_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p226_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p226_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p226_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p226_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p226_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p226_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p226_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p226_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p226_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p226_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p226_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p226_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p226_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p226_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p226_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p226_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p226_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p226_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p226_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p226_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p226_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p226_025,"He has not been named.
"
p226_026,"That's no bad thing.
"
p226_027,"They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
"
p226_028,"Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
"
p226_029,"We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
"
p226_030,"Because we do not need it.
"
p226_031,"This is the window.
"
p226_032,"I was an athlete.
"
p226_033,"From that day on we started to look for another full back.
"
p226_034,"Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
"
p226_036,"It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
"
p226_037,"It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
"
p226_039,"It has failed.
"
p226_040,"It was clear.
"
p226_041,"It is not for any other purpose.
"
p226_042,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p226_043,"Is there a new way forward?
"
p226_044,"Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
"
p226_045,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p226_046,"Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
"
p226_047,"We need to chat.
"
p226_048,"It's a blessing.
"
p226_049,"But it might have done.
"
p226_050,"Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
"
p226_051,"It has been a horrible, horrible time.
"
p226_052,"It is the whole package.
"
p226_053,"He had no enemies.
"
p226_054,"I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
"
p226_055,"However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
"
p226_056,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p226_057,"It's the big omission.
"
p226_058,"Next league matches Celtic.
"
p226_059,"She's a spy!
"
p226_060,"It is unique.
"
p226_061,"It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
"
p226_062,"This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
"
p226_063,"It's a real challenge.
"
p226_064,"It is not great art.
"
p226_065,"You do not change overnight.
"
p226_066,"Art is extra.
"
p226_067,"It's a matter of balance.
"
p226_068,"Scotland had great assets.
"
p226_069,"I've spent a lot of time on buses.
"
p226_070,"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
"
p226_071,"I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
"
p226_072,"Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
"
p226_073,"The script was funny.
"
p226_074,"You need a trademark.
"
p226_075,"Painful, but only because it's true.
"
p226_076,"Help is needed.
"
p226_077,"Tommy is not a problem.
"
p226_078,"There could be a way back.
"
p226_079,"Neither it is.
"
p226_080,"The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
"
p226_082,"It is a terrible place.
"
p226_083,"It works for us.
"
p226_084,"I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
"
p226_085,"It can be halted.
"
p226_086,"This is the way things should be handled.
"
p226_088,"Detection is often difficult.
"
p226_089,"He seems to be pleased with the picture.
"
p226_090,"New Zealand rugby is totally different.
"
p226_091,"Someone who cares
"
p226_092,"It's just awful.
"
p226_093,"It's never too late.
"
p226_094,"Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
"
p226_095,"That will come after the game on Saturday.
"
p226_096,"However, it did not end that way.
"
p226_097,"We could not get any possession.
"
p226_098,"If you could find it.
"
p226_099,"He is hungry for success and I am the same.
"
p226_100,"They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
"
p226_101,"It was mayhem.
"
p226_102,"I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
"
p226_103,"They were outside the circle.
"
p226_104,"However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
"
p226_105,"May not have been at fault?
"
p226_106,"It was some time before she found out he was safe.
"
p226_107,"It was a good performance.
"
p226_108,"That time is not now, however.
"
p226_109,"Oil embargo endorsed.
"
p226_110,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p226_111,"It was an adventure.
"
p226_112,"The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
"
p226_113,"The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this.
"
p226_114,"It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
"
p226_115,"I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
"
p226_116,"It is normal.
"
p226_117,"I don't have many friends.
"
p226_118,"We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
"
p226_119,"Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
"
p226_120,"It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
"
p226_121,"Maybe this battle has been.
"
p226_122,"Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
"
p226_124,"This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
"
p226_125,"She's got to say something.
"
p226_126,"It is a delight on every level.
"
p226_127,"We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
"
p226_128,"I felt very strongly that England should have it.
"
p226_129,"She has been shot.
"
p226_130,"I thought it was a fantastic game.
"
p226_131,"I was furious.
"
p226_132,"Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
"
p226_133,"She really suffered for her art.
"
p226_134,"It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
"
p226_135,"I do not think this family will ever get over this.
"
p226_136,"Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
"
p226_137,"It will be too hot.
"
p226_138,"The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
"
p226_139,"I am now unemployed.
"
p226_140,"They made such decisions in London.
"
p226_141,"Our intentions are real.
"
p226_142,"Government will intervene.
"
p226_143,"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
"
p226_144,"Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
"
p226_145,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p226_146,"It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
"
p226_148,"Three penalties were given.
"
p226_149,"In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
"
p226_150,"We just had a go.
"
p226_151,"We have seen a copy of the report.
"
p226_152,"That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
"
p226_153,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p226_154,"Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
"
p226_155,"It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
"
p226_156,"The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
"
p226_157,"Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
"
p226_158,"We will turn the corner.
"
p226_159,"The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
"
p226_160,"They should stop the bombing.
"
p226_161,"These days are long gone.
"
p226_162,"It is an attitude of mind.
"
p226_163,"I've learned from my mistakes.
"
p226_164,"They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
"
p226_165,"We have to move forward.
"
p226_166,"However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
"
p226_167,"They will do their own thing.
"
p226_168,"It is too much for me.
"
p226_169,"Nobody did in those days.
"
p226_171,"A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
"
p226_172,"It became a book by itself.
"
p226_173,"His team management was protective.
"
p226_174,"It's quite a routine.
"
p226_175,"It is not either national standards or local control.
"
p226_176,"If that's the case, he will struggle.
"
p226_177,"I took the gun.
"
p226_178,"Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
"
p226_179,"No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
"
p226_180,"I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
"
p226_181,"I've been there.
"
p226_183,"I have no sympathy with her at all.
"
p226_184,"It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
"
p226_185,"It is not fair.
"
p226_186,"It just came into my head that day.
"
p226_187,"I had a train to catch.
"
p226_188,"Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
"
p226_189,"The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
"
p226_190,"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
"
p226_191,"Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
"
p226_192,"People will ask about us.
"
p226_193,"The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
"
p226_194,"It is a case of taking a risk.
"
p226_195,"It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
"
p226_197,"There was no option.
"
p226_198,"Is that it?
"
p226_199,"We live by the rule of law.
"
p226_200,"Is that success?
"
p226_201,"The service from the other players was super.
"
p226_202,"They are in the euro.
"
p226_203,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p226_204,"The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
"
p226_205,"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
"
p226_206,"Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
"
p226_207,"It's a mixture of everything.
"
p226_208,"I don't want to use it.
"
p226_209,"Now, it's all right.
"
p226_210,"It's like a garage.
"
p226_211,"But I am a worried man.
"
p226_212,"They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
"
p226_213,"Feel the heat?
"
p226_214,"I'm pleased about one thing.
"
p226_215,"I am delighted for Simon.
"
p226_216,"His third goal was superb.
"
p226_217,"It's not ideal.
"
p226_218,"I was so nervous.
"
p226_219,"I might come back.
"
p226_220,"For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
"
p226_221,"Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
"
p226_223,"But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
"
p226_224,"It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
"
p226_225,"A career as a doctor is on hold.
"
p226_226,"At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
"
p226_227,"Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
"
p226_228,"I am immensely sad.
"
p226_229,"I'd never seen a play about me.
"
p226_230,"The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
"
p226_231,"The track is currently covered in snow.
"
p226_232,"My wife and family are the support system.
"
p226_233,"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
"
p226_234,"Stewart will travel with some confidence.
"
p226_235,"Police later said the scheme would end in November.
"
p226_236,"It is set in Paris.
"
p226_237,"It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
"
p226_238,"Hospitals are for the ill.
"
p226_239,"It would still have been a good film, but very different.
"
p226_240,"She is well balanced.
"
p226_241,"They are all bright and different.
"
p226_242,"It's only fair.
"
p226_243,"We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
"
p226_244,"It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
"
p226_245,"I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
"
p226_246,"His body was never found.
"
p226_247,"We did not compete with any other local farmer.
"
p226_248,"I was shocked.
"
p226_249,"I should think so, too.
"
p226_251,"There's the mix.
"
p226_252,"There will be widespread support on all sides.
"
p226_253,"I was never going to play against Scotland.
"
p226_254,"At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
"
p226_255,"That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
"
p226_256,"Blair is very positive at European Councils.
"
p226_257,"Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
"
p226_258,"That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
"
p226_259,"Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
"
p226_260,"It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
"
p226_261,"He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
"
p226_262,"Today we can say that a new era has begun.
"
p226_263,"I would have the hammer in the crowd.
"
p226_264,"This court has made an order which has not been observed.
"
p226_265,"The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
"
p226_266,"The warning is timely.
"
p226_267,"George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
"
p226_268,"That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
"
p226_269,"They are never here.
"
p226_270,"We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
"
p226_271,"He was popular.
"
p226_272,"Frankly, we should all have such problems.
"
p226_273,"It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
"
p226_274,"She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
"
p226_276,"It's a way of life.
"
p226_278,"I feel pretty good.
"
p226_279,"In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
"
p226_280,"He has a wealth of experience.
"
p226_281,"It happens from time to time.
"
p226_283,"He looked very sharp.
"
p226_284,"Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
"
p226_285,"It was a virus.
"
p226_286,"Yet, it worked.
"
p226_287,"Who will perform?
"
p226_288,"The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
"
p226_289,"This is a national crisis.
"
p226_290,"Scotland were beaten again.
"
p226_291,"It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
"
p226_292,"It goes back a long way.
"
p226_293,"He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
"
p226_294,"The results are sometimes contentious.
"
p226_295,"He should have won.
"
p226_296,"If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
"
p226_297,"There's a pause.
"
p226_298,"The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
"
p226_299,"There was no hint of scandal.
"
p226_300,"I thought it was my only chance.
"
p226_301,"However, the snow was welcomed by some.
"
p226_302,"Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
"
p226_303,"One was a lawyer.
"
p226_304,"Our task is to complete the picture.
"
p226_305,"A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
"
p226_306,"We believe the world has too many refugees already.
"
p226_307,"The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
"
p226_308,"This is a war over our home.
"
p226_309,"In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
"
p226_310,"It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
"
p226_311,"I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
"
p226_312,"It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
"
p226_313,"The minister is the engineer.
"
p226_314,"I did not name it.
"
p226_315,"It was a question of patience.
"
p226_316,"The whole region is in shock.
"
p226_317,"It's about my time as a guitarist.
"
p226_318,"Kids are terrible.
"
p226_319,"Craig is a major concern for us.
"
p226_320,"The home team had an amazing start.
"
p226_321,"My body is clearly capable.
"
p226_322,"Referees are easy targets.
"
p226_323,"He said she was mad.
"
p226_324,"We are in the end game.
"
p226_325,"I am very happy to be here.
"
p226_326,"The airport was even different.
"
p226_327,"We do the same.
"
p226_328,"That's the law of the land.
"
p226_329,"But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
"
p226_330,"The weekly average was three hours.
"
p226_331,"Donald was his friend.
"
p226_332,"I am so upset.
"
p226_333,"It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
"
p226_334,"On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
"
p226_335,"The boat was fantastic.
"
p226_336,"It is a time bomb.
"
p226_337,"I'd like to take the plunge.
"
p226_338,"Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
"
p226_339,"My view has now completely changed.
"
p226_340,"You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
"
p226_341,"In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
"
p226_342,"Three years ago he would have been.
"
p226_343,"I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
"
p226_344,"He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
"
p226_345,"They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
"
p226_346,"But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
"
p226_347,"It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
"
p226_348,"Look at the witnesses.
"
p226_349,"He's been the key to everything.
"
p226_350,"That is the very reason why it was so vital.
"
p226_351,"This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
"
p226_352,"His contract was then not renewed.
"
p226_353,"A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
"
p226_354,"That is a break with tradition.
"
p226_355,"A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
"
p226_356,"She is free.
"
p226_357,"I kept going for her.
"
p226_358,"You must have a government and a good civil service.
"
p226_359,"He's very explosive.
"
p226_360,"No other job in world football can compare to this one.
"
p226_361,"Our numbers are small.
"
p226_362,"Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
