p351_001,Please call Stella.
p351_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p351_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p351_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p351_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p351_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p351_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p351_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p351_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p351_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p351_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p351_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p351_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p351_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p351_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p351_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p351_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p351_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p351_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p351_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p351_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p351_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p351_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p351_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p351_025,It was by the numbers.
p351_026,I don't think they can complain about that.
p351_027,I have not seen the term immediate.
p351_028,My Dad is a hero.
p351_029,It is my fault.
p351_030,He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
p351_031,"He added, We have the same desire."
p351_032,Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
p351_033,As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
p351_034,Teachers have been given the offer.
p351_035,We have to win every game.
p351_036,They also have good neighbours.
p351_037,Both sides will be aware of this.
p351_038,They are not advertised.
p351_039,I have got a wife to feed.
p351_040,We are getting people into work.
p351_041,Will we ever play together again?
p351_042,What are the barriers?
p351_043,He is keen to stay in public service.
p351_044,Who are the democrats?
p351_045,You had to go and see him.
p351_046,What did you learn in school today?
p351_047,We know we can defend it.
p351_048,That is not the case.
p351_049,He met his wife and married in England.
p351_050,Instead we were shot in the back.
p351_051,This isn't a gimmick.
p351_052,I won't go back.
p351_053,There is no signature on this document.
p351_054,We could not compete with Rangers.
p351_055,There was mystery back then.
p351_056,We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
p351_057,Now it has become a big picture.
p351_058,The jury is still out.
p351_059,"Hopefully, they will not go through with it."
p351_060,They have been very lucky with the ice.
p351_061,We are not the first to be affected.
p351_062,My players are special.
p351_063,We are the gateway to justice.
p351_064,The devil is in the detail.
p351_065,His handling raises a wider issue.
p351_066,We have got the school holidays on.
p351_067,We can't go home.
p351_068,That just wasn't good enough.
p351_069,The working families tax credit is far better.
p351_070,those who are preparing to give up.
p351_071,"It's really good, as long as we play well."
p351_072,I feel alive and good today.
p351_073,She was married with one son.
p351_074,"There may be some work in construction, but not enough."
p351_075,It was a pretty terrible day.
p351_076,His track record is impressive.
p351_077,Clearly it is very disturbing.
p351_078,"It is tough, but possible."
p351_079,This youngster is so exciting!
p351_080,I don't understand it.
p351_081,"The band was good, and it's been a great day."
p351_082,He was rejected because he had retired.
p351_083,I just wanted to get off the course.
p351_084,She was also very brave.
p351_085,He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
p351_086,Friday night was a pretty good night.
p351_087,Things are meant to be.
p351_088,"One year later, he finally decided to act."
p351_089,"That doesn't just happen, you have to build it."
p351_090,This is already happening.
p351_091,We have a rehearsal.
p351_092,Four had been brought down.
p351_093,Only he's not as young as he looks.
p351_094,The matter is under discussion.
p351_095,"Glasgow, however, did not get a mention."
p351_096,Surely this is not supposed to happen?
p351_097,This is a defining moment in this parliament.
p351_098,They have played their part.
p351_099,They were unable to revive him.
p351_100,He confirmed that the document was valid.
p351_101,In part that reflected the times.
p351_102,That is not true.
p351_103,"Yes, it was too short a night."
p351_104,I didn't deserve to be sent off.
p351_106,We have no excuses.
p351_107,- Really you will !
p351_108,The driver was unhurt.
p351_109,Who will pay for this?
p351_110,"This is wrong, but it's what is believed."
p351_111,You have caught a serial killer.
p351_112,"It's all about money, money, money."
p351_113,What's the problem?
p351_114,"Finally, they have a journey back to their youth."
p351_115,The way forward isn't going to be easy.
p351_116,It's the way we go about it.
p351_117,I will be ridiculed.
p351_118,There's nothing new in that argument.
p351_119,This time it was out of the blue.
p351_120,We need to get the right people in.
p351_121,It is a great shame.
p351_122,We were not going to take that risk.
p351_123,Last night he became one of the hunted.
p351_124,But that isn't what is worrying the Farmer.
p351_125,Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p351_126,"In my opinion, it was not working perfectly."
p351_127,"The truth, of course, is very different."
p351_128,He has something in common with the Wallabies.
p351_129,These will take a little time to develop.
p351_130,I might come back.
p351_131,He said it was the worst possible result.
p351_132,"But, still, it wasn't working."
p351_133,That was my mistake.
p351_134,We can play better than that.
p351_135,My whole family is.
p351_136,"However, everyone should do it once in their life."
p351_137,A career as a doctor is on hold.
p351_138,During the communist time they were very privileged.
p351_139,There has been no delay on government orders.
p351_140,I think we can overcome it.
p351_141,We will be victorious.
p351_142,The other question is why the scaling down?
p351_143,It was the crowning point of my career.
p351_144,But it will be sorted out this week.
p351_145,It's just a fact.
p351_146,Mr Smith was dismissive.
p351_147,It was a discussion paper.
p351_148,My neighbours are horrified.
p351_149,They will be ready.
p351_150,Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
p351_151,He is walking free.
p351_152,There is nothing they can't do.
p351_153,It certainly was a birthday to remember.
p351_154,"If you can work, you should work."
p351_155,This was a very tragic accident.
p351_156,THE Paragon Ensemble is back.
p351_157,"If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere."
p351_158,It is the voice of the survivors.
p351_159,The whole thing in general is moving on.
p351_160,They might also be parlous.
p351_161,Paterson can afford to be generous.
p351_162,No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p351_163,The other is the existence of male colleagues.
p351_164,I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
p351_165,It is not an escape.
p351_166,It feels that the game is off.
p351_167,He is very confident at the moment.
p351_168,"Well, what can you do?"
p351_169,It is not the message alone.
p351_170,They will be seen for years to come.
p351_171,I'm really happy with how things went there.
p351_172,He will be greatly missed.
p351_173,"Sadly, they don't seem to know."
p351_174,But is that possible?
p351_175,"In many ways, that is as important."
p351_176,I think we're going to make it.
p351_177,It was really frustrating.
p351_178,Clubs can only do so much.
p351_179,Many other areas are coming up.
p351_180,It would have very little impact on them.
p351_181,She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p351_182,That's the way things are heading.
p351_183,We were extremely poor.
p351_184,The parties have no contact.
p351_185,He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
p351_186,We are still paying the price for that.
p351_187,It was better than a soap opera.
p351_188,There will be no change in government.
p351_189,I am just grateful he is alive.
p351_190,This is a special place for me.
p351_191,"This was a great result for us, a big result."
p351_192,Our policy is clear.
p351_193,This was an hour before the show.
p351_194,It is crucial to understand this in context.
p351_195,I now know that from memory.
p351_196,Another one said the couple came from Inverness.
p351_197,We expect a full house on the night.
p351_198,He invented the language.
p351_199,We want to play at the worlds.
p351_200,We need to know more about her.
p351_201,I went away to recover fully.
p351_202,Ownership was the game.
p351_203,It makes a huge difference.
p351_204,The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p351_205,It's not a new device.
p351_206,"Like everything in Scotland, it takes time."
p351_207,Six years is too long.
p351_208,They are not a set of options.
p351_209,It's a very important and beautiful day.
p351_210,If only the problems concerned the players.
p351_211,But it was money well spent.
p351_212,That's the most important thing for me.
p351_213,"At the end of the day, one has to be careful."
p351_214,No decision has yet been made.
p351_215,I have had a lovely summer.
p351_216,Which is fair enough.
p351_217,He took over our lives.
p351_218,The problem is worse in Scotland.
p351_219,This is a historic agreement.
p351_220,He had worked there for only two days.
p351_221,We just want them home.
p351_222,"His was the best performance of the day, after all."
p351_223,I was happily surprised.
p351_224,It may not even be possible.
p351_225,I think it is a scandal.
p351_226,Perhaps it was just as well.
p351_227,"That, though, was then."
p351_228,I grew up with them.
p351_229,It was the train coming.
p351_230,I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p351_231,We are pursuing legal action against the government.
p351_232,Perhaps that was their mistake.
p351_233,We've never seen so many.
p351_234,The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p351_235,"I am very, very happy."
p351_236,The case was continued.
p351_237,That is important for the club.
p351_238,He is doing the right things.
p351_239,Blood samples were taken.
p351_240,Now he is in charge of this.
p351_241,They want to play in the World Cup.
p351_242,He was embarrassed about what he did.
p351_243,This is excellent news for the workforce.
p351_244,The home team also had their moments.
p351_245,Haven't been so lucky since.
p351_246,He is under no illusions.
p351_247,It got no better.
p351_248,Some were close to tears.
p351_249,It has become a way of life.
p351_250,They seem to turn up for them.
p351_251,That is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
p351_252,Now we are back on top of Europe.
p351_253,Now the show is for public consumption.
p351_254,I want to create events.
p351_255,"I wish it wasn't so, but it is."
p351_256,"The old manager, he didn't like me."
p351_257,We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
p351_258,The ministers are now to make their decision.
p351_259,It was like being in prison.
p351_260,I think it was his parents.
p351_261,That is very important to people.
p351_262,I certainly hope not.
p351_263,This is a dream come true for me.
p351_264,No other country has ever won this tournament.
p351_265,There he goes again.
p351_266,"However, there could be more bad weather to come."
p351_267,I feel pretty good.
p351_268,It's got to come from me.
p351_269,There were moments of humour too.
p351_270,He has a wealth of experience.
p351_271,Don't you think it was a fine performance?
p351_272,It happens from time to time.
p351_273,"All my family are in Scotland, from Glasgow."
p351_274,They were too hard.
p351_275,This is not a message from ministers.
p351_276,We have been very patient.
p351_277,I don't take that view.
p351_278,They have a car and cannot afford another.
p351_279,My only concern is for my children.
p351_280,This is welcome news.
p351_281,The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p351_282,We just wish they had done so before.
p351_283,It was a virus.
p351_284,"The rest, of course, is history."
p351_285,They chose the latter.
p351_286,That was not the norm.
p351_287,"I've not said anything to them, they know."
p351_288,It is giving out the wrong message.
p351_289,I feel it is very irrational.
p351_290,We were used to being in control.
p351_291,He's had a lot of injury problems.
p351_292,Brady lost to Sullivan one hole.
p351_293,"It happened again, and again, and again."
p351_294,Does it matter?
p351_295,She thought she was going to die.
p351_296,Were they under-age?
p351_297,You are going to go to jail.
p351_298,It is a very worrying report.
p351_299,"I started it, but then forgot all about it."
p351_300,My mind was made up.
p351_301,It was an ongoing exercise.
p351_302,I would love to see it back there.
p351_303,He then did just that.
p351_304,He should have won.
p351_305,He could hardly have been in greater demand.
p351_306,Who can predict?
p351_307,It was all very proper and civilised.
p351_308,I've played them all in the Champions League.
p351_309,Then you see it.
p351_310,And it had been a marvellous occasion.
p351_311,We don't believe anything anymore.
p351_312,Either system could have prevented the crash.
p351_313,"Here, the fans have been fantastic."
p351_314,There is good quality.
p351_315,"For his opposite number, this was a just triumph."
p351_316,But these things are happening now.
p351_317,He will be really pleased about this.
p351_318,He had no access to the database.
p351_319,They were not up to the required standard.
p351_320,He also seems to have been around forever.
p351_321,"However, it has had only a limited uptake."
p351_322,"At the moment, it is very difficult to know."
p351_323,Others are expected to do so soon.
p351_324,They were impressive against France.
p351_325,Seven people were already in custody in France.
p351_326,I played well but missed a few chances.
p351_327,Our approach will be different.
p351_328,It's my initial background.
p351_329,The board is currently resolving its differences.
p351_330,They're just a nonsense.
p351_331,"That has not been the case, as we now know."
p351_332,He also called in at another farm.
p351_333,But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.
p351_334,He will go a long way.
p351_335,"Hopefully, he will get a lucky break."
p351_336,I lost a part of me.
p351_337,It's so much more fun.
p351_338,That's just the kind of thing we have.
p351_339,It's getting to me.
p351_340,So we talked about that for a bit.
p351_341,But he has strong links to Labour.
p351_342,I am proud of my team.
p351_343,I am a doctor.
p351_344,"Secondly, there are other options for patients."
p351_345,It will carry on.
p351_346,Our season is not over.
p351_347,I am not retiring.
p351_348,Money is not everything in life.
p351_349,She kept him on a string.
p351_350,It will make a big difference.
p351_351,There was no basis for their arrest.
p351_352,This latter suggestion is very important.
p351_353,The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p351_354,The Government has listened.
p351_355,It's only tackling congestion.
p351_356,That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p351_357,It's too horrible to think.
p351_358,It can be frightening.
p351_359,"He was, but only just."
p351_360,"It may be his last for a while, too."
p351_361,Further details are expected later.
p351_362,What's wrong with that?
p351_363,You will never forget the clutching horror.
p351_364,Off with their heads.
p351_365,I believe she was elected unopposed.
p351_366,We are not asking for the moon.
p351_367,Now we see the impact of global politics.
p351_368,The pain is still acute.
p351_369,This was not the show for me.
p351_370,It is a very big problem.
p351_371,Frustration is not the word.
p351_372,The police have to act to help them.
p351_373,The cause is just.
p351_374,"It may be down, but New York is not out."
p351_375,Our message is getting through.
p351_376,But what lies ahead?
p351_377,She makes me so happy.
p351_378,They promised to fight the plans.
p351_379,My heart is not so sure.
p351_380,I am happy for her.
p351_381,"Finally, he paid for the movie."
p351_382,They were just too good for us.
p351_383,He was the architect.
p351_384,This should include procedures for personal imports.
p351_385,It's a fantastic achievement.
p351_386,Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
p351_387,Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.
p351_388,"He, too, was not satisfied."
p351_389,It's easy to see why.
p351_390,But it didn't happen.
p351_391,All were believed to be adults.
p351_392,This is the last straw.
p351_393,The research was my life.
p351_394,"I am so, so, so lucky."
p351_395,What is it about this series?
p351_396,You read it right.
p351_397,They would have been forgiven for doing so.
p351_398,I only wanted to give her a fright.
p351_399,Where does it come from?
p351_400,You find it bizarre?
p351_401,I am very excited about this season.
p351_402,It has proved a double whammy.
p351_403,Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p351_404,"It should be a great game, though."
p351_405,But is he?
p351_406,So it's a daily struggle.
p351_407,But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p351_408,"If it's not, they didn't go far enough."
p351_409,Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
p351_410,Everyone has his share of trouble.
p351_411,You need a licence to run a pub.
p351_412,Everything else is second.
p351_413,I am not sure.
p351_414,This is a successful outcome.
p351_415,His first album was a hit.
p351_416,The salary changes are long overdue.
p351_417,The plane was shaking.
p351_418,It was visibly on fire.
p351_419,"What's it for, after all?"
p351_420,We will be pleased to talk to them.
p351_421,A number of people could not speak English.
p351_422,They have got off with murder.
p351_423,I'm going to take it further.
p351_424,I kept going for her.
