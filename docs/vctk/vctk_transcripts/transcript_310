p310_001,Please call Stella.
p310_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p310_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p310_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p310_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p310_006,"When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p310_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p310_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p310_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p310_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p310_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p310_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p310_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
p310_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p310_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p310_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to the home in the skies.
p310_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p310_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p310_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow."
p310_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p310_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p310_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p310_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p310_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p310_025,He was the youngest of the British team.
p310_026,I fell in love with the ballet.
p310_027,"That their music is truly, truly, truly great."
p310_028,It feels like a winner already.
p310_029,Did you see that?
p310_030,The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p310_031,And the winners are.
p310_032,I can't believe something like this could happen.
p310_033,"Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment."
p310_034,"He didn't really, we just made that up."
p310_035,Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p310_036,"Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion."
p310_037,It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
p310_038,We're still talking with a few people.
p310_039,But one shouldn't go by that.
p310_040,"Nothing is lost, everything is recycled."
p310_041,Buying our way out is not an option.
p310_042,There are big names.
p310_043,That argument has been won.
p310_044,"Normally, they have been a pack of lies."
p310_045,"He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother."
p310_046,And who would argue with that?
p310_047,I hope you will leave it at that.
p310_048,We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p310_049,They had four children together.
p310_050,"Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised."
p310_051,Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p310_052,I fell to the ground.
p310_053,"They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed."
p310_054,They were not defeated.
p310_055,"Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran."
p310_056,How can they engage with the work?
p310_057,All of us know it exists.
p310_058,Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
p310_059,This is the band.
p310_060,She has a wonderful mind.
p310_061,There are just two tournaments remaining.
p310_062,We're into that build-up now.
p310_063,It is the end of an era.
p310_064,We shall not do that.
p310_065,I have had no social life at all.
p310_066,Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p310_067,"Once again, he refused."
p310_068,This is about the Orange Order.
p310_069,"In fact, they will not be disciplined."
p310_070,We're not the tourist board.
p310_071,"Sub Not Used, McKenzie."
p310_072,"Apart from that, they would not be making any comment."
p310_073,The Commons is too outdated.
p310_074,"Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week."
p310_075,That was then and this is now.
p310_076,Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p310_077,Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p310_078,Are you watching Liverpool?
p310_079,He would be with his peers.
p310_080,They seem to be backing off from that.
p310_081,But it took a lot of bottle.
p310_082,They don't work anymore anyway.
p310_083,"I wish they, too, would get a grip."
p310_084,I am so sorry.
p310_085,This avalanche is just beginning.
p310_086,Journalists should make him.
p310_087,I believe we have a good chance.
p310_088,"However, it is no longer with the national team."
p310_089,She may even appear in some more films.
p310_090,This is the best moment of my career.
p310_091,He also called in at another farm.
p310_092,I don't know why she is not here.
p310_093,"England could not take anything for granted, however."
p310_094,I agree with them.
p310_095,I feel very strongly about that.
p310_096,Now he will have to start again.
p310_097,It is a difficult thing to explain.
p310_098,I don't know how it happened.
p310_099,Peter doesn't want to leave.
p310_100,After that nothing could save him.
p310_101,Construction is due to begin in February.
p310_102,We shall rely on human beings.
p310_103,"In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth."
p310_104,He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p310_105,His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p310_106,It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p310_107,"Or, rather, it isn't."
p310_108,The picture is the same across Scotland.
p310_109,Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p310_110,My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p310_111,There are lots of these women in Finland.
p310_112,I will not be in dialogue with her.
p310_113,But there is another side.
p310_114,Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p310_115,There is no guarantee.
p310_116,I'm confident we can turn things around.
p310_117,"We want to get to the final, anyway."
p310_118,It may be argued.
p310_119,He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p310_120,I bought a car at auction.
p310_121,"And who were they anyway, beforehand?"
p310_122,His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
p310_123,Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p310_124,Five in a month isn't good enough.
p310_125,"Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker."
p310_126,This is just one example.
p310_127,Both offices were closed yesterday.
p310_128,"They don't have to, but they normally do."
p310_129,We stopped at half-time.
p310_130,"Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn."
p310_131,David was not either.
p310_132,Britain may now be forced to listen.
p310_133,We don't see it as downgrading.
p310_134,He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p310_135,No date has been set for the appeal.
p310_136,He is dying from cancer.
p310_137,People can describe a moment in their life.
p310_138,What's the rush?
p310_139,The starting point is pretty unusual.
p310_140,"However, they will only be found in the wild."
p310_141,They receive a high profile in the media.
p310_142,It was an ambush.
p310_143,I think this proposal is excellent.
p310_144,"If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid."
p310_145,Is that too much to ask?
p310_146,The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p310_147,I've so much respect for him.
p310_148,Each one has its own system.
p310_149,I felt under no pressure today.
p310_150,The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p310_151,And that was the adults.
p310_152,"Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim."
p310_153,This is a job for the Government.
p310_154,I felt the head was very like me.
p310_155,We started with that.
p310_156,And he had much need.
p310_157,Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p310_158,This can only help us go forward.
p310_159,It's never the same problem.
p310_160,"But, even so, you always want to try something new."
p310_161,Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
p310_162,I hadn't been looking after myself.
p310_163,I was over the moon.
p310_164,"And really, the songs are the key thing."
p310_165,"Four minutes later, the show was over."
p310_166,His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p310_167,Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
p310_168,And then came the seventies.
p310_169,I guess it is down to focus.
p310_170,"Last week, he was taken to the hospital."
p310_171,"You can leave him, knowing the job will be done."
p310_172,His track record is not promising.
p310_173,"No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her."
p310_174,He put a lot of effort into it.
p310_175,"However, you have just got to adjust it."
p310_176,That was moving the goalposts.
p310_177,He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p310_178,"We have the location, which is assured."
p310_179,The club are feeling no different today.
p310_180,"What if the confession is, after all, a fake?"
p310_181,I see the extended family once a year.
p310_182,I'm not a magician.
p310_183,We couldn't go very fast.
p310_185,There was even a joke.
p310_186,"Tony Blair, can you see her face?"
p310_187,This guy is never going to give up.
p310_188,They had previously been on five-day notice.
p310_189,"But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding."
p310_190,The show is small but perfectly formed.
p310_191,This is the first job of the director - leadership.
p310_192,"It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege."
p310_193,It is too early to speculate.
p310_194,I just had so much fun.
p310_195,Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p310_196,I will wait until later.
p310_197,Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p310_198,"She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak."
p310_199,Or so we have long assumed.
p310_200,They responded with victories.
p310_201,That was the personal impulse.
p310_202,"I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies."
p310_203,But first it goes out on TV.
p310_204,What is the truth about the cow?
p310_205,They will want to watch a winning team.
p310_206,I think it's awful.
p310_207,Who is going to be penalised?
p310_208,This will be just another tax on motorists.
p310_209,I feel sorry for the Reds.
p310_210,One must hope not!
p310_211,He is a Satan.
p310_212,Just see where the blood is coming from.
p310_213,He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p310_214,"In her opinion, the rich are different."
p310_215,"Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention."
p310_216,"I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about."
p310_217,There was no cohesion.
p310_218,He was jailed for five years.
p310_219,"Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers."
p310_220,We will not break even.
p310_221,We will look into it.
p310_222,"IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does."
p310_223,But he's not afraid to take risks.
p310_224,Some of his family still live there.
p310_225,"However, they continued in their pursuit of victory."
p310_226,"However, it very nearly went wrong."
p310_227,Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p310_228,Things are moving together.
p310_229,I get to work with very good people.
p310_230,A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p310_231,He must not be removed from office.
p310_232,"Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare."
p310_233,"Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly."
p310_234,Look at the table.
p310_235,This film will be totally awesome.
p310_236,I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p310_237,Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p310_238,Last year was not a good year.
p310_239,It's a difficult job.
p310_240,We can't get over it.
p310_241,Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p310_242,My preference is for the single vaccines.
p310_243,This represents a tough game for us.
p310_244,He saw it all as a big game.
p310_245,They are not an item.
p310_246,And thought we would get away with it.
p310_247,I can't wait for the outdoors.
p310_248,It's more like a Labour Party rally.
p310_249,Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p310_250,I would urge the Government to think again.
p310_251,It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p310_252,They were on holiday in Egypt.
p310_253,I was happiest with my short game.
p310_254,"We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?"
p310_255,We went on to become very successful.
p310_256,"Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward."
p310_257,"No, is the answer to your first question."
p310_258,"We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't."
p310_259,That could be at least five years away.
p310_260,That is my role.
p310_261,He also presented You Bet!
p310_262,That's the day job.
p310_263,It really is taken seriously.
p310_264,We have not given up hope.
p310_265,I'm looking at ways to do that now.
p310_266,Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p310_267,It's such a trial!
p310_268,That kind of growth is the important thing.
p310_269,I think it is totally wrong.
p310_270,And a film maker was born.
p310_271,It was also put on the Internet.
p310_272,The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
p310_273,And yet his legacy is doubtful.
p310_274,It seems to have worked.
p310_275,Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p310_276,There was a battle there.
p310_277,"This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming."
p310_278,"Well, when did he ever refuse?"
p310_279,Today's ruling confirms that.
p310_280,It's good news and long overdue.
p310_281,THE atmosphere was electric.
p310_282,I'd never heard him in person before.
p310_283,We're going to change our party.
p310_284,Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p310_285,I have learned a lot from him.
p310_286,Is he any good in the kitchen?
p310_287,He has been campaigning for change for years.
p310_288,A formal decision will be announced within months.
p310_289,He must have something up his sleeve.
p310_290,He was at home with his pals.
p310_291,We make good weapons.
p310_292,"So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England."
p310_293,This is not a Scottish problem.
p310_294,Then followed a bout of flu.
p310_295,The balance isn't there at EMI.
p310_296,That was the most annoying thing.
p310_297,We are being hijacked.
p310_298,We had no part in it.
p310_299,"It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny."
p310_300,Mike Tyson went to prison.
p310_301,It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p310_302,Our young people are leaving.
p310_303,And there is no cause for it.
p310_304,That would have been too easy.
p310_305,She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p310_306,This is not a faceless system.
p310_307,This is a long-term discussion paper.
p310_308,In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p310_309,It is just like the stock market.
p310_310,The damage from the fire was huge.
p310_311,"That's what it's all about, isn't it?"
p310_312,Both agreed on the success of the event.
p310_313,"What, then, is the real thing?"
p310_314,Boarding school was equally protective.
p310_315,Most people know that.
p310_316,It will be the final push.
p310_317,"Clearly, this was the important nursing."
p310_318,"Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives."
p310_319,The campaign was raucous.
p310_320,"On Saturday, it was much the same."
p310_321,But both were involved with other matters.
p310_322,But we were wrong.
p310_323,The result today is an impasse.
p310_324,"However, in October another partnership was announced."
p310_325,There is no threat to them.
p310_326,Nelson does not disappoint.
p310_327,The goal will stay with me forever.
p310_328,The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p310_329,Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p310_330,It is a high time to act.
p310_331,Then we will face the Danish champions.
p310_332,"He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display."
p310_333,The South African defended his work ethic.
p310_334,We have a team to reach the final.
p310_335,There was barely a handful of chances.
p310_336,The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
p310_337,I have found my vision.
p310_338,We don't know the scale of need.
p310_339,You need a reason for staying.
p310_340,"Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong."
p310_341,"However, we have not come to any conclusions."
p310_342,I don't expect to see that this time.
p310_343,"You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back."
p310_344,The big issue for us is the review.
p310_345,That is not the way we should operate.
p310_346,"More likely, perhaps, it is that he will stay in England."
p310_347,The new work will begin in the autumn.
p310_348,The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p310_349,He showed he has some things to learn.
p310_350,Or do they?
p310_351,They are the innocent victims.
p310_352,It is now time for justice.
p310_353,That is of no use.
p310_354,I could have been offended.
p310_355,Now it is measuring it in dollars.
p310_356,But he is frustrated at every turn.
p310_357,"He was down the right, the left, and through the middle."
p310_358,This is the lowest of the low.
p310_359,"Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius."
p310_360,"Clearly, it is time to meet this young man."
p310_361,He's a nice guy.
p310_362,The milk industry is in turmoil.
p310_363,I love the moment of being first.
p310_364,It is a decision which has paid off.
p310_365,Their mind was already made up.
p310_366,I had some time with Aston Villa.
p310_367,But it's got to be worth it.
p310_368,But does the same thing happen with music?
p310_369,I just couldn't believe what had happened.
p310_370,Alex is a big part of that future.
p310_371,Pray that is so.
p310_372,In fact it isn't related to either.
p310_373,There was support from across the board.
p310_374,There may be some evidence to this effect.
p310_375,"It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition."
p310_376,So what does one do?
p310_377,Such actions are rarely popular.
p310_378,The methadone programme is completely out of control.
p310_379,That is why it's so lyrical.
p310_380,I joined a group.
p310_381,I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p310_382,It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
p310_383,It has removed a bit of guilt.
p310_384,And they all had these other commitments.
p310_385,"However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far."
p310_386,"Here, again, they were denied a voice."
p310_387,They were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.
p310_388,"Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey."
p310_389,I never agreed with that.
p310_390,I didn't actually believe them at first.
p310_391,Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p310_392,We knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.
p310_393,"We always thought it should be digital, and cheap."
p310_394,There was only one hole in it.
p310_395,I don't think it's vital.
p310_396,It might not survive the process.
p310_397,They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p310_398,My father died in childbirth.
p310_399,The issue has still to be resolved.
p310_400,Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p310_401,It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p310_402,I'm happy to contribute to that.
p310_403,"Despite the result, it was still a great moment."
p310_404,"We were close, but not close enough."
p310_405,And that started me thinking.
p310_406,"Offered the gold medal, he declined."
