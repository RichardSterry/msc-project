p360_001,Please call Stella.
p360_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p360_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p360_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p360_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p360_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p360_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p360_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p360_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p360_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p360_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p360_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p360_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p360_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p360_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p360_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p360_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p360_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p360_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p360_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p360_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p360_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p360_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p360_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p360_025,You can never take a win for granted.
p360_026,My conscience is not clear.
p360_027,Is that it?
p360_028,You have been warned.
p360_029,You are not allowed to do that.
p360_030,That depends on Rangers.
p360_031,There are two problems.
p360_032,"Lose, and they would be ridiculed."
p360_033,It's something which is very important to me.
p360_034,For once he was wrong.
p360_035,He would not have to explain.
p360_036,I want to deliver a learning society.
p360_037,We are just happy that hasn't happened.
p360_038,I had to be into it.
p360_039,I'm so grateful for that.
p360_040,It's not been a good year.
p360_041,A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.
p360_042,I have no intention of resigning today.
p360_043,That has now gone.
p360_044,Donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.
p360_045,This will take up to nine months.
p360_046,And maybe they have.
p360_047,"Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers."
p360_048,Is he conscious?
p360_049,But we are confident.
p360_050,It is like a football team.
p360_051,When he came to see me on Monday.
p360_052,That's a concern to me.
p360_053,She said she was really sorry.
p360_054,That will be important.
p360_055,But here it is also very bad.
p360_056,That view has not altered.
p360_057,It was very full anyway.
p360_058,"As for the warning, it was not needed."
p360_059,The incidents are not believed to be linked.
p360_060,But there is no easy option.
p360_061,I can't believe she is dead.
p360_062,No person was charged.
p360_063,But it would say that.
p360_064,Most of the works are small in scale.
p360_065,He was pronounced dead at the scene.
p360_066,Only the bomber was killed.
p360_067,But he just carried on anyway.
p360_068,Nor was it a game without its lessons.
p360_069,It was that kind of afternoon.
p360_070,His presence was very important.
p360_071,What happens next?
p360_072,They couldn't believe what had happened.
p360_073,The bombing begins in five minutes.
p360_074,That took two weeks.
p360_075,"It's worth it, though."
p360_076,That perhaps is behind the problem.
p360_077,I have to hand it to the bank.
p360_078,The question was simple enough.
p360_079,The voters rejected us.
p360_080,There was a definite prejudice.
p360_081,Nothing is going right at the moment.
p360_082,We never publicise it.
p360_083,You will be very welcome.
p360_084,His musicals were very much of their time.
p360_085,He became enchanted with the process.
p360_086,This year the exercise is being repeated.
p360_087,It seems very odd.
p360_088,They couldn't keep it together.
p360_089,We discovered that for ourselves.
p360_090,We will continue to provide support for them.
p360_091,I've always been very taken by the drink.
p360_092,It was looking bad.
p360_093,That's what makes it interesting.
p360_094,It's nice to be involved.
p360_095,It's not a game.
p360_096,Buildings are about people.
p360_097,There is much work to do.
p360_098,The release attracted little attention.
p360_099,It was the dreaded sentence.
p360_100,I have never considered it.
p360_101,It is not in the public interest.
p360_102,They had been forced to walk.
p360_103,It is harder than you think.
p360_104,The call was ignored.
p360_105,I am looking forward to it.
p360_106,Consumers will also benefit.
p360_107,That would be even more disastrous.
p360_108,We opened up and everything was gone.
p360_109,It is looking very special.
p360_110,They offered to make an investment into it.
p360_111,People were hitting the floor.
p360_112,She was close to suicide at one stage.
p360_113,They took a risk.
p360_114,Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p360_115,It has no place in football.
p360_116,It is frustrating that we cannot do that.
p360_117,This is a classic.
p360_118,He played it like a veteran.
p360_119,I have spoken to head office.
p360_120,I'm not thinking about anyone else.
p360_121,They will run a mile.
p360_122,When she went off it was quite amazing.
p360_123,Britain has never had it so good.
p360_124,So many people will be affected by this.
p360_125,It was all very good stuff.
p360_126,Or was it?
p360_127,We are under no illusions about this.
p360_128,But they are a good team.
p360_129,We have a long way to go.
p360_130,I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p360_131,"Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people."
p360_132,I knew that we needed to get out.
p360_133,I had a train to catch.
p360_134,And this game is all about belief.
p360_135,I am ready for that.
p360_136,It is a fantasy.
p360_137,The only safe investment is cash.
p360_138,That's the way they are.
p360_139,Elections would follow in about two years.
p360_140,We are trying to be realistic.
p360_141,That was the theory.
p360_142,Or so it seemed.
p360_143,Now we look forward to it.
p360_144,That was worth it.
p360_145,What's it going to be then?
p360_146,Who was being affected?
p360_147,Our players are exhausted.
p360_148,It is deeply frustrating.
p360_149,He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p360_150,We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p360_151,This has been carried out.
p360_152,Our time is up.
p360_153,It was a moment of madness.
p360_154,But other Ministers are not convinced.
p360_155,First meeting was next week.
p360_156,"No, we were not exactly favourites."
p360_157,Conditions were very difficult for the players.
p360_158,This solution is not being considered in Scotland.
p360_159,I didn't think we deserved to go out.
p360_160,"However, we will have to wait and see."
p360_161,I told them they shouldn't say that.
p360_162,I don't know how they do it.
p360_163,Little is known about them.
p360_164,It is a new company for Scotland.
p360_165,We're very unhappy about it.
p360_166,A good actor doesn't think.
p360_167,But the action is about to be restarted.
p360_168,It was extremely difficult.
p360_169,It is about the script for me.
p360_170,I have a good feeling about this.
p360_171,And the results were impressive.
p360_172,The next game is today.
p360_173,Hopefully it will be a good day.
p360_174,I was a silly bastard.
p360_175,There is an ongoing problem with this company.
p360_176,The process will start tomorrow.
p360_177,Was the punishment excessive?
p360_178,The police have an awful lot to explain.
p360_179,That's when you hope to take advantage.
p360_180,I could easy do that.
p360_181,We are really impressed.
p360_182,I try to be clear in the narrative.
p360_183,You have to wait.
p360_184,I did not see anything to begin with.
p360_185,It's their moment of choice.
p360_186,I certainly do not agree with that.
p360_187,It was a disaster of a race.
p360_188,Only one person can claim the credit.
p360_189,Maintain the highest standards.
p360_190,What could we do?
p360_191,O Neill has delivered.
p360_192,But there was no going back.
p360_193,There are some good people in there.
p360_194,But it won't make a difference.
p360_195,I'm not going to blame the band.
p360_196,I think that he got the message.
p360_197,Here it was very subdued.
p360_198,Stardom is a funny thing.
p360_199,"They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on."
p360_200,The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.
p360_201,I sincerely hope not.
p360_202,I'm really looking forward to that.
p360_203,She would say he was still the best.
p360_204,It is dangerous and it is a lie.
p360_205,"We didn't, and it worked for us."
p360_206,No-one has used it since then.
p360_207,The baby was dead.
p360_208,That remains the unanswered question.
p360_209,Everyone is too upset to comment.
p360_210,They tried to give her advice.
p360_211,We should have no more problems.
p360_212,Pensions are a long-term investment.
p360_213,An announcement is expected soon.
p360_214,It was one of those things.
p360_215,I can understand that.
p360_216,But sometimes it was even worse.
p360_217,We had to work hard for it.
p360_218,That's a big reduction.
p360_219,There will be good prospects ahead.
p360_220,I was pleased about that.
p360_221,That has not changed.
p360_222,It's a creative energy.
p360_223,We are not conducting the review.
p360_224,It just never comes together.
p360_225,The club has never won it.
p360_226,His leader wanted to celebrate.
p360_227,So it was at Easter Road.
p360_228,It will be a huge difference.
p360_229,Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
p360_230,The characters are always the first attraction.
p360_231,We've got better players here.
p360_232,We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p360_233,This is wonderful news.
p360_234,So what's it all about?
p360_235,I think he was lost for words.
p360_236,"In fact, it is deeply unpleasant."
p360_237,I want to celebrate the World Cup.
p360_238,This is a historic occasion.
p360_239,No-one expected that their parents would stay.
p360_240,And what happens?
p360_241,It is all very upbeat.
p360_242,I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p360_243,We're looking for unity in the council.
p360_244,The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p360_245,We deserved the draw.
p360_246,"Just one of those things, we suppose."
p360_247,It's up to the defence team.
p360_248,No one was injured.
p360_249,We have had our debate.
p360_250,It is part of his game.
p360_251,Did he just want to be on telly?
p360_252,But it was too late.
p360_253,I didn't see the point.
p360_254,It seems a shame to leave it.
p360_255,Who would have thought it?
p360_256,They were all on a mission.
p360_257,Human beings are always the same.
p360_258,You will gain from that.
p360_259,It makes me feel difficult.
p360_260,We couldn't believe it at first.
p360_261,The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p360_262,He could still be President.
p360_263,It can take a long time.
p360_264,I don't intend to do so now.
p360_265,There is no answer to it.
p360_266,He was pleased with his display.
p360_267,The first time you read a play.
p360_268,There was no let-up for the minnows.
p360_269,The bottom line is that this must stop.
p360_270,He is having a nightmare.
p360_271,That was six years ago.
p360_272,Players have to accept this.
p360_273,He is completely committed to us.
p360_274,Neither had the public.
p360_275,It disappeared into the cup.
p360_276,They might well be right.
p360_277,I have no further comment to make.
p360_278,The warning is timely.
p360_279,Those were the days.
p360_280,The joint bid is still on course.
p360_281,A press conference is about politics.
p360_282,It was important to bring them all together.
p360_283,We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
p360_284,They tend to be female and retired.
p360_285,These things happen in football but shouldn't.
p360_286,It looks as though he will be right.
p360_287,We know the fight is going to happen.
p360_288,I have played well the past two days.
p360_289,Is it on a building site?
p360_290,That is the key.
p360_291,We've been here before.
p360_292,I am in a good position.
p360_293,I have never been unemployed.
p360_294,We are in it for the long-term.
p360_295,But it didn't bother me.
p360_296,I believe it will happen.
p360_297,And Michael was just great.
p360_298,He did it well.
p360_299,Why have you decided to get married?
p360_300,Is it all real?
p360_301,He will be missed.
p360_302,I would not descend to that level.
p360_303,They were not at the property yesterday.
p360_304,We will not tolerate it.
p360_305,I'm really proud of her.
p360_306,What does this mean?
p360_307,They are not falling now.
p360_308,We are not physical at all.
p360_309,Have we not been here before?
p360_310,I've been waiting a long time.
p360_311,The meaning is very profound and complex.
p360_312,You just have to get on with it.
p360_313,The response from everyone was wonderful.
p360_314,And that match was played in June.
p360_315,We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.
p360_316,I don't mean in a frightening way.
p360_317,He is a sort of a mystery figure.
p360_318,I have learned a lot.
p360_319,It won't be their last.
p360_320,You've got to have both sides.
p360_321,He has yet to receive a reply.
p360_322,It has been only average.
p360_323,He should be worried about me.
p360_324,"Hopefully, it will be good enough."
p360_325,"For me, any manager is good."
p360_326,Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p360_327,That was the gimmick.
p360_328,He refused to name the survivors.
p360_329,He has changed my life forever.
p360_330,I have no idea.
p360_331,This plan is all about respect.
p360_332,I don't think he played his best.
p360_333,Pakistan denied the report.
p360_334,It will be up to the government.
p360_335,That is a tragedy.
p360_336,I am very happy.
p360_337,A child is not a product.
p360_338,But this is nonsense.
p360_339,You can't get the experience in Austria.
p360_340,I'm going to miss it.
p360_341,There will be no backing down.
p360_342,The atmosphere was excellent.
p360_343,That must have had an effect.
p360_344,They have brought in the replacement.
p360_345,How did it all come about?
p360_346,We are working so hard.
p360_347,One was a lawyer.
p360_348,Our position is extremely simple.
p360_349,Where did that finish?
p360_350,I suppose it is quite exciting really.
p360_351,The most important thing was to win today.
p360_352,Golf is not like that.
p360_353,This is a moment to seize.
p360_354,I would not do that.
p360_355,Lots of them haven't recovered that far.
p360_356,They said that they stood by their statement.
p360_357,That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p360_358,That has to be allowed.
p360_359,He has never let them down.
p360_360,There was no-one of the required standard.
p360_361,That would be very good for Rangers.
p360_362,It's something he has worked very hard on.
p360_363,It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p360_364,That gives it a spirit.
p360_365,She has never been back.
p360_366,It will set the tone.
p360_367,They are not going away.
p360_368,"Having done it, he was asked again."
p360_369,I think he will.
p360_370,The package is a changing one.
p360_371,"I'm working on that one, too."
p360_372,"Frankly, that's not good enough."
p360_373,Or is it?
p360_374,What's the difference?
p360_375,The whole family was in shock.
p360_376,But everywhere the problems are the same.
p360_377,Craig is a major concern for us.
p360_378,The problems began a long time ago.
p360_379,It meant a lot to us.
p360_380,What other retailer would do this?
p360_381,Other musicians were found in retirement.
p360_382,This country has many challenges.
p360_383,Their families are gone.
p360_384,IS Tony Blair on drugs?
p360_385,I didn't do it.
p360_386,They are with their father.
p360_387,They're all doing it.
p360_388,I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p360_389,"No, they are not the same thing."
p360_390,In football it is not always the case.
p360_391,Sometimes we find a person.
p360_392,It is a natural reaction.
p360_393,I am in a very difficult position.
p360_394,I had to win this race.
p360_395,They could have been told in advance.
p360_396,And what do we have?
p360_397,It is a relief.
p360_398,The boat was fantastic.
p360_399,These were the edited highlights.
p360_400,That is the difference.
p360_401,You will need it.
p360_402,There is so much at stake.
p360_403,It has great potential.
p360_404,They had three children.
p360_405,"It was all too little, too late."
p360_406,"Still, it is a very good result for us."
p360_407,And he's not alone.
p360_408,What was all that about?
p360_409,What's the problem with change?
p360_410,I intend to end it on a high.
p360_411,What she can't have is the money.
p360_412,I thought they played well.
p360_413,This is not the end.
p360_414,And they went on to win the title.
p360_415,"Now, she will not be running at all."
p360_416,It's not an impression.
p360_417,This was great for our sport.
p360_418,There's no place to hide.
p360_419,I don't think they are too serious.
p360_420,Tiger is the exception.
p360_421,There was no happy ending.
p360_422,They need time to think.
p360_423,It's unfair on her.
p360_424,"As for Owen, class is permanent."
