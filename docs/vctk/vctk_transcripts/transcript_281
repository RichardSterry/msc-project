p281_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p281_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p281_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p281_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p281_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p281_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p281_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p281_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p281_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p281_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p281_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p281_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p281_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p281_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p281_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p281_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p281_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p281_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p281_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p281_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p281_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p281_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p281_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p281_025,"She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
"
p281_026,"They are very clever in their use of words.
"
p281_027,"In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
"
p281_028,"Smoking is also very important.
"
p281_029,"It's not going to work out that way.
"
p281_030,"They've got their own agenda.
"
p281_031,"I'd just like to play.
"
p281_032,"Our fans have been marvellous.
"
p281_033,"We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
"
p281_034,"He should emerge as the winner.
"
p281_035,"She failed in her action.
"
p281_036,"Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
"
p281_037,"It carried a double message.
"
p281_038,"It is a financial matter.
"
p281_039,"This film will be totally awesome.
"
p281_040,"They want to be entertained.
"
p281_041,"A week is a long time in politics.
"
p281_042,"I am just going to go for it.
"
p281_043,"There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.

p281_045,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p281_046,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p281_047,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p281_048,"That was the theory, anyway.
"
p281_049,"However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
"
p281_050,"I had come back from London.
"
p281_051,"Pulled a huge number of viewers.
"
p281_052,"The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
"
p281_053,"I must take a seat.
"
p281_054,"That is very hard, alone.
"
p281_055,"The Government should be ashamed.
"
p281_056,"None has ever been found.
"
p281_057,"There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
"
p281_058,"We should be able to cope.
"
p281_059,"It was a lovely experience.
"
p281_060,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p281_061,"We will pay their bills.
"
p281_062,"Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
"
p281_063,"The standard is extremely high.
"
p281_064,"Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
"
p281_065,"Only water is currently allowed.
"
p281_066,"The tournament has now been cancelled.
"
p281_067,"It is a real problem.
"
p281_068,"I have proved that in the past.
"
p281_069,"He had been a singer.
"
p281_070,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p281_071,"How are you, sir ?
"
p281_072,"So is that it, then ?
"
p281_073,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p281_074,"The players will be down.
"
p281_075,"They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
"
p281_076,"There could be a lot of confusion.
"
p281_077,"He also received a medal of honour.
"
p281_078,"Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
"
p281_079,"Mini rugby is a great thing.
"
p281_080,"He is in the queue.
"
p281_081,"I first met him last summer.
"
p281_082,"Last week, he was taken into hospital.
"
p281_083,"Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
"
p281_084,"Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
"
p281_085,"Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
"
p281_086,"The error appeared in a warrant.
"
p281_087,"He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
"
p281_088,"The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
"
p281_089,"IT is called a killing in the trade.
"
p281_090,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p281_091,"We could not get any possession.
"
p281_092,"Officers recovered a second body in the area.
"
p281_093,"I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
"
p281_094,"The conclusion is the same.
"
p281_095,"It is a vicious circle.
"
p281_096,"But I know the course.
"
p281_097,"We must stop it with the golf ball.
"
p281_098,"We live by the rule of law.
"
p281_099,"This is a national crisis.
"
p281_100,"Otherwise, the market may come back.
"
p281_101,"The following are the principal provisions.
"
p281_102,"Movement has to take place.
"
p281_103,"City sentiment is in his favour.
"
p281_104,"It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
"
p281_105,"It's not a lack of confidence.
"
p281_106,"It was a funny game.
"
p281_107,"What do we do ?
"
p281_108,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p281_109,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p281_110,"That is the only way forward.
"
p281_111,"They are at a very early stage.
"
p281_112,"The whole thing is the music.
"
p281_113,"Or it would have been.
"
p281_114,"His is a success story by any standard.
"
p281_115,"Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
"
p281_116,"Such actions are rarely popular.
"
p281_117,"I've heard this stuff about the markets.
"
p281_118,"It is much as it has been described.
"
p281_119,"They've got to account for it.
"
p281_120,"Then again, we could have.
"
p281_121,"We have a training class.
"
p281_122,"Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
"
p281_123,"Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
"
p281_124,"It has removed a bit of guilt.
"
p281_125,"She does not want to speak.
"
p281_126,"Scottish Life was there over one year.
"
p281_127,"Twaddle is a case in point.
"
p281_128,"That is far too high.
"
p281_129,"They made such decisions in London.
"
p281_130,"There were no serious injuries.
"
p281_131,"She was also very brave.
"
p281_132,"He wants to win a major.
"
p281_133,"First meeting was next week.
"
p281_134,"I never wanted a legal battle.
"
p281_135,"We will try to find someone.
"
p281_136,"People come from all round the world to see it.
"
p281_137,"We have seen a copy of the report.
"
p281_138,"He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
"
p281_139,"But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
"
p281_140,"Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
"
p281_141,"It is not just about pay.
"
p281_142,"It opens the door to the Champions League.
"
p281_143,"It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
"
p281_144,"I was caught out a little bit.
"
p281_145,"The FBI could become involved.
"
p281_146,"There's only one team in Ayrshire.
"
p281_147,"Three hours later, the man was free.
"
p281_148,"We have a clean bill of health.
"
p281_149,"It is not normal practice.
"
p281_150,"It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
"
p281_151,"The family kept away from me.
"
p281_152,"One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
"
p281_153,"My Dad is a hero.
"
p281_154,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p281_155,"And does it ?
"
p281_156,"Are you from the rugby ?
"
p281_157,"Had I heard ?
"
p281_158,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p281_159,"Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
"
p281_160,"This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
"
p281_161,"The strong pound also took its toll.
"
p281_162,"It is a terrible tragedy.
"
p281_163,"Shareholders may have to wait until June to be paid.
"
p281_164,"I have got a wife to feed.
"
p281_165,"We have a budget in March.
"
p281_166,"The pension levels will remain the same.
"
p281_167,"They will do their own thing.
"
p281_168,"Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
"
p281_169,"Our position remains the same.
"
p281_170,"It's nice to be nice.
"
p281_171,"The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
"
p281_172,"They could not match it.
"
p281_173,"To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
"
p281_174,"Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
"
p281_175,"One season, they might do well.
"
p281_176,"You've got to be vigilant.
"
p281_177,"The second aspect was the fear of failure.
"
p281_178,"I feel like my game has come a long way.
"
p281_179,"The Hibs manager is no fool.
"
p281_180,"It is not either national standards or local control.
"
p281_181,"If that's the case, he will struggle.
"
p281_182,"The hotel was now for sale.
"
p281_183,"I can't even get into the A team.
"
p281_184,"They know no other way.
"
p281_185,"The referee had a good game.
"
p281_186,"I am not ready to walk away.
"
p281_187,"Says the Duke of York.
"
p281_188,"The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
"
p281_189,"Our destiny is in our own hands.
"
p281_190,"He prefers to play for them.
"
p281_191,"I have accepted the challenge.
"
p281_192,"You know the sort of thing.
"
p281_193,"They were seriously after him.
"
p281_194,"It was an odd affair, in many respects.
"
p281_195,"And this game is all about belief.
"
p281_196,"Aberdeen had little to offer.
"
p281_197,"That would be my view.
"
p281_198,"It decided to blame the media.
"
p281_199,"We always felt we could win.
"
p281_200,"This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
"
p281_201,"This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
"
p281_202,"It's very difficult to find a buyer.
"
p281_203,"Because he was born in England.
"
p281_204,"There was no way back for United after that.
"
p281_205,"It was a test in itself.
"
p281_206,"No details of the talks were given.
"
p281_207,"This will be our new beginning.
"
p281_208,"They have the cash and the fire power.
"
p281_209,"We believe a third party was involved.
"
p281_210,"Tommy is not a problem.
"
p281_211,"The sanctions are about collective punishment.
"
p281_212,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p281_213,"This is a holy place.
"
p281_214,"He had suffered a heart attack.
"
p281_215,"The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
"
p281_216,"You have caught a serial killer.
"
p281_217,"We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
"
p281_218,"You are a great player.
"
p281_219,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p281_220,"Does the name matter ?
"
p281_221,"how do you get it back ?
"
p281_222,"What are you not good at ?
"
p281_223,"You have got to look at speed of response.
"
p281_224,"It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
"
p281_225,"We're very unhappy about it.
"
p281_226,"This gives a financial incentive to switch.
"
p281_227,"HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
"
p281_228,"I had relied on him.
"
p281_229,"I'm just a regular person.
"
p281_230,"It had all been arranged.
"
p281_231,"Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
"
p281_232,"I am considered a teenager.
"
p281_233,"Anyway, the job will be part-time.
"
p281_234,"This will secure the future of our industry.
"
p281_235,"I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
"
p281_236,"For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
"
p281_237,"It was a crazy day.
"
p281_238,"It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
"
p281_239,"That has been the easy part.
"
p281_240,"You could feel the heat.
"
p281_241,"We played them off the pitch.
"
p281_242,"After that nothing could save him.
"
p281_243,"This is the year of the Tiger.
"
p281_244,"Wilson will tell the truth.
"
p281_245,"She died in middle age.
"
p281_246,"We just had a go.
"
p281_247,"Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
"
p281_248,"It is set in Paris.
"
p281_249,"He has run a hell of a race.
"
p281_250,"That is still in place.
"
p281_251,"Half of young people had had contact with the police.
"
p281_252,"The irony was not lost.
"
p281_253,"The pig industry is on its knees.
"
p281_254,"It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
"
p281_255,"The minister is the engineer.
"
p281_256,"He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
"
p281_257,"She took them for a term.
"
p281_258,"Kingfisher can afford to wait.
"
p281_259,"You can never tell with the manager.
"
p281_260,"Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
"
p281_261,"Persuaded to change his mind.
"
p281_262,"Either way, the investor retains the premium.
"
p281_263,"The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
"
p281_264,"In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
"
p281_265,"I should think so, too.
"
p281_266,"Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
"
p281_267,"There will be widespread support on all sides.
"
p281_268,"That would depend on the parole board.
"
p281_269,"The capital costs are modest.
"
p281_270,"That could be in place by next year.
"
p281_271,"On the contrary they stand to gain.
"
p281_272,"He looked like a schoolboy.
"
p281_273,"England could only play the other team on the park.
"
p281_274,"He took over our lives.
"
p281_275,"That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
"
p281_276,"We feel very good about it.
"
p281_277,"It does not work that way in Scottish football.
"
p281_278,"For him then it's a labour of love.
"
p281_279,"We are aiming for early March.
"
p281_280,"It is also very valuable.
"
p281_281,"The demand is created by the supply.
"
p281_282,"Not many companies can say that these days.
"
p281_283,"I realised I was lucky to have it.
"
p281_284,"That view has not altered.
"
p281_285,"And they were being paid ?
"
p281_286,"was everything done to save people ?
"
p281_287,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p281_288,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p281_289,"It has the potential to be another North Sea.
"
p281_290,"Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
"
p281_291,"He was also married with two children.
"
p281_292,"The target is to break even by Christmas.
"
p281_293,"You have to expect this type of thing.
"
p281_294,"They seem to get away with it.
"
p281_295,"We have to be very, very careful.
"
p281_296,"The partnership was set up during the summer.
"
p281_297,"It is a symbolic concert.
"
p281_298,"Hopefully, this week will be good.
"
p281_299,"This is the correct decision.
"
p281_300,"He added that the business was in good shape.
"
p281_301,"The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
"
p281_302,"Scotch beef is badly missed.
"
p281_303,"The rescue package is public money.
"
p281_304,"We are not doing the Today programme.
"
p281_305,"There should be room for creative dissent.
"
p281_306,"These figures are truly awful.
"
p281_307,"We need to increase the membership.
"
p281_308,"The real issue is personal.
"
p281_309,"Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
"
p281_310,"Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
"
p281_311,"He was at home with his pals.
"
p281_312,"The dealer is on notice.
"
p281_313,"The party lasted all night.
"
p281_314,"We are in the end game.
"
p281_315,"They come to enjoy themselves.
"
p281_316,"Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
"
p281_317,"The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
"
p281_318,"That meant the search was unlawful.
"
p281_319,"This may be perfectly innocent.
"
p281_320,"Scotland has shown the way.
"
p281_321,"He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
"
p281_322,"The letters are going out today.
"
p281_323,"I can see their argument.
"
p281_324,"The Premier League has been a huge success.
"
p281_325,"It is all credit to them today.
"
p281_326,"The whole family was in shock.
"
p281_327,"That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
"
p281_328,"The actor has met with Mandela.
"
p281_329,"There is no shortage of farmers.
"
p281_330,"It's difficult to predict the future.
"
p281_331,"It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
"
p281_332,"But the Farmer is bemused.
"
p281_333,"To beat the European champion is quite nice.
"
p281_334,"However, the groups denied the claims.
"
p281_335,"The airport was even different.
"
p281_336,"There was no time scale.
"
p281_337,"Does that put pressure on us ?
"
p281_338,"Did it work ?
"
p281_339,"Do you think we are a top nation ?
"
p281_340,"In his absence, the council adopted the change.
"
p281_341,"It's just the way I play.
"
p281_342,"The figures are bad, but not that bad.
"
p281_343,"Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
"
p281_344,"On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
"
p281_345,"I have a moral dilemma.
"
p281_346,"It was almost too much.
"
p281_347,"It will now be unveiled in the US in July.
"
p281_348,"Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
"
p281_349,"The idea was first mooted a year ago.
"
p281_350,"He did a good job.
"
p281_351,"It's a policy which has worked for us.
"
p281_352,"It intends to do so on Wednesday.
"
p281_353,"I think this proposal is excellent.
"
p281_354,"The Allies intend to maintain the average.
"
p281_355,"He deserves a top team.
"
p281_356,"It is all about having physical evidence.
"
p281_357,"It should be a great game, though.
"

"
p281_368,"The major championships will always have a special place.

"
p281_385,"He has been a success this year.
"
p281_386,"In fact, he was great today.
"
p281_387,"Now, though, he has an incentive.
"
p281_388,"A review is under way.
"
p281_389,"It is a simple equation.
"

"
p281_412,"That is a personal matter.
"
p281_413,"He seems to be used to the attention.
