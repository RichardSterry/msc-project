p334_001,Please call Stella.
p334_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p334_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p334_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p334_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p334_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p334_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p334_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p334_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p334_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p334_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p334_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p334_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p334_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p334_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p334_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p334_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p334_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p334_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p334_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p334_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p334_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p334_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p334_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p334_025,A judicial review is also being considered.
p334_026,I want to win this thing.
p334_027,"Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected."
p334_028,I'd just like to play.
p334_029,"It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more."
p334_030,"Nothing is lost, everything is recycled."
p334_031,It was no surprise.
p334_032,It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p334_033,I don't know why you say goodbye.
p334_034,Appointed general secretary last September.
p334_035,Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p334_036,We could feel the heat.
p334_037,"Darrell was, however, adamant."
p334_038,He was a member of the Tartan Army.
p334_039,I think it can count against you now.
p334_040,I wanted to win so badly.
p334_041,It was an accounting error.
p334_042,I had enough on.
p334_043,The offer of help is there for anyone.
p334_044,There were no passengers on board.
p334_045,And we're not there yet.
p334_046,No meaningful response was issued.
p334_047,"And the funny thing is, they usually do."
p334_048,"Times have changed, but have they improved?"
p334_049,Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p334_050,We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p334_051,Later we discovered it was a hoax.
p334_052,It is a form of physical exercise.
p334_053,plays in dark blue.
p334_054,"But, by that time, of course, it is again."
p334_055,It is something that we will put right.
p334_056,Why do it?
p334_057,It could take three days.
p334_058,"Hopefully, it will be built by next year."
p334_059,It was totally my fault.
p334_060,Or so everyone believed.
p334_061,"It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council."
p334_062,Perhaps we should do the same.
p334_063,Tomorrow night is the important game.
p334_064,He's very good at relating to adults.
p334_065,He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p334_066,Every aspect of our play was first class.
p334_067,Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p334_068,It was a move which appealed to him.
p334_069,There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p334_070,He will need that machine.
p334_071,"But there are problems, such as retraining new staff."
p334_072,We are looking for volunteers.
p334_073,I had a sense of deja vu.
p334_074,It was very personal and very intimate.
p334_075,By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p334_076,I was inspired by two things.
p334_077,They follow him everywhere.
p334_078,I couldn't make out what was going on.
p334_079,Maybe that was the whole point.
p334_080,The feeling between the two men was mutual.
p334_081,They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p334_082,"So we said, no, we're not going to do that."
p334_083,This must be really short of ideas.
p334_084,It was extremely cold.
p334_085,They use them for everything.
p334_086,We have the easy part.
p334_087,"I had a choice, and didn't have to do that."
p334_088,"They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the justice minister."
p334_089,The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p334_090,Mr Miller is married with three children.
p334_091,"Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious."
p334_092,"We already have them, all over Europe."
p334_093,There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p334_094,Libya is an easy target.
p334_095,I thought they played very well.
p334_096,It was a foolhardy decision.
p334_097,It means they actually control the programme.
p334_098,"And also, whatever he does, can he really win?"
p334_099,They chose to side with terror.
p334_100,Justice was not seen today.
p334_101,I would never even consider it.
p334_102,"Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game."
p334_103,We should just say no.
p334_104,We are not out of touch with politics.
p334_105,That was a gold medal for certain.
p334_106,"Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise."
p334_107,I didn't make those adjustments.
p334_108,We are satisfied with this outcome.
p334_109,We have it on video.
p334_110,Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p334_111,There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p334_112,It didn't take long.
p334_113,This meeting is the path to salvation.
p334_114,"Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many."
p334_115,"I was very pleased with them today, though."
p334_116,"If you're going to do it, do it right."
p334_117,He told the conference.
p334_118,The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p334_119,We tend to come good at the end.
p334_120,He also received a medal of honour.
p334_121,It's not one for the purist.
p334_122,It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p334_123,"For one veteran, the memories remain vivid."
p334_124,"He did his best, but it wasn't good enough."
p334_125,There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p334_126,It is a time bomb.
p334_127,It's a matter of huge concern.
p334_128,This could be a recipe for conflict.
p334_129,We are taking advice on this.
p334_130,I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p334_131,It was just an accident of birth.
p334_132,"However, we will obviously keep the matter under review."
p334_133,It was a simple question.
p334_134,Some of his family still live there.
p334_135,"I've no doubt about it, it was actually from her."
p334_136,"By that time, however, it was already too late."
p334_137,"Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?"
p334_138,Could you put it in writing?
p334_139,This is the New Edinburgh.
p334_140,We all thought we were going to die.
p334_141,And that's good news for the magpies.
p334_142,That will come after the game on Saturday.
p334_143,Our offer will remain on the table.
p334_144,The world is split into two.
p334_145,They deserve a lot of credit.
p334_146,I would ask the fans to be patient.
p334_147,It was so physical.
p334_148,Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p334_149,"He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera."
p334_150,Why is that?
p334_151,It is extremely sad.
p334_153,Europe is a hugely contentious issue.
p334_154,It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p334_155,And therein lies the whole problem.
p334_156,He was not deterred.
p334_157,This commitment should be built upon.
p334_158,"This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle."
p334_159,The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p334_160,That is not just my personal view.
p334_161,The investment will be in the food.
p334_162,"But he was a full, working member of our staff."
p334_163,The problem is the pitch.
p334_164,That's as it should be.
p334_165,It does seem a mystery.
p334_166,"Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight."
p334_167,He looked very sharp.
p334_168,The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
p334_169,Two of the team became ill.
p334_170,We have taken steps to rectify it.
p334_171,I see no need for change.
p334_172,Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p334_173,But the Premiership is everything to us.
p334_174,Do yourselves a favour.
p334_175,"Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe."
p334_176,But we have come under attack.
p334_177,The new system will be marketed this summer.
p334_178,"What do they do, anyway?"
p334_179,He was just like a godfather to it.
p334_180,I'd love to be like Peter.
p334_181,I disagree entirely with the decision.
p334_182,Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p334_183,That is his attitude to things.
p334_184,Then came the collision with Sergio.
p334_185,"And what was that like, as an experience?"
p334_186,Thirteen people will be made redundant.
p334_187,I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p334_188,No finals are to be contested today.
p334_189,This is not a struggle against Islam.
p334_190,That night was a terrible muddle.
p334_191,His English counterpart agreed.
p334_192,Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p334_193,It is in our own hands.
p334_194,This is a step backwards.
p334_195,We may make a short-term appointment.
p334_196,He will address the nation this evening.
p334_197,Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p334_198,I'm not changing my mind.
p334_199,I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p334_200,We believe that the reason is poverty.
p334_201,Tony Blair is obviously panicking.
p334_202,We welcome this increase in the minimum wage.
p334_203,"The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt."
p334_204,I'm trying to stay open on that.
p334_205,They serve a multitude of purposes.
p334_206,We'll have to work hard today.
p334_207,The frustration was showing.
p334_208,"Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it."
p334_209,It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p334_210,You have obviously got an answer to it.
p334_211,My friends were very envious.
p334_212,But who cares?
p334_213,The house was full of smoke.
p334_214,The approval system will be changed.
p334_215,So the European elections are extremely important.
p334_216,Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p334_217,That period was a struggle.
p334_218,We are determined to establish the facts.
p334_219,You just have to accept.
p334_220,We must improve our relations with government.
p334_221,"This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal."
p334_222,The list is too long for this piece.
p334_223,"If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute."
p334_224,I can't blame the fans.
p334_225,That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p334_226,"Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied."
p334_227,But that attachment took a lot of growing.
p334_228,This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p334_229,"However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland."
p334_230,So far they have refused.
p334_231,He is adamant that he is innocent.
p334_232,"To all intents and purposes, he ran the show."
p334_233,The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p334_234,He took my breath away.
p334_235,"It's good fun, and makes it so much more interesting."
p334_236,I will have to order its destruction.
p334_237,After that it is up to the boss.
p334_238,I never wanted a legal battle.
p334_239,"This influence, to the audience, is like an arrow."
p334_240,Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
p334_241,It had won an investors in people award.
p334_242,A venue was found.
p334_243,They are not an item.
p334_244,"Basically, the classical tradition won out."
p334_245,Is that Titanic?
p334_246,He was to get his chance.
p334_247,"So, the question is, is it any good?"
p334_248,I'll always remember the horrible images.
p334_249,That's why they go to the opera.
p334_250,"Well, it's not before time, is it?"
p334_251,They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p334_252,"The trouble is, though,there is no simple solution."
p334_253,I'm getting back up there now.
p334_254,Check that he is dead.
p334_255,I couldn't see any reason not to die.
p334_256,My players have no idea about football.
p334_257,They are there to get people into work.
p334_258,The balance isn't there at EMI.
p334_259,I am getting long in the tooth.
p334_260,They would be wise to do just that.
p334_261,He was sentenced to seven years.
p334_262,"That, he claimed, was essential."
p334_263,I would like Glasgow.
p334_264,Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
p334_265,It felt like my support system was leaving.
p334_266,Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p334_267,The weaknesses are few.
p334_268,I may think about performing it.
p334_269,I would recommend it.
p334_270,"Crucially, though, United were still alive."
p334_271,"Charles Gordon, leader of the Glasgow City Council declined to comment."
p334_272,She'd gone to the Catholic school.
p334_273,"Where was their passion, the power and feeling?"
p334_274,You can't go back and change things.
p334_275,We are on a four-year mission.
p334_276,This is a lie.
p334_277,"Instead, it is back to the drawing board."
p334_278,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance."
p334_279,Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p334_280,They should stop the bombing.
p334_281,They'll have to pay more.
p334_282,Military chiefs were playing it straight.
p334_283,"Does it, Noel?"
p334_284,Adams is surely worth a chance.
p334_285,I will never manage another Scottish club.
p334_286,The Open champion is back.
p334_287,It's going to be a new challenge.
p334_288,It's the taking part that counts.
p334_289,They married in August last year.
p334_290,I want to keep him.
p334_291,We haven't actually considered it down here.
p334_292,You've been a great audience.
p334_293,He was telling me to keep quiet.
p334_294,"By then, however, both men were already in the US."
p334_295,We were given a warm and friendly reception.
p334_296,"He also wants to play in this game, and that's important."
p334_297,We have been extremely lucky this time.
p334_298,People are fed up.
p334_299,Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p334_300,It's a sign of the times.
p334_301,But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p334_302,I just need a bit of luck.
p334_303,"Once we have done that, the tender will be put out."
p334_304,Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p334_305,He is a Satan.
p334_306,I always felt they played for me.
p334_307,"If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut."
p334_308,They must be kept on the ground.
p334_309,"Again, it's about responding to your resources."
p334_310,"However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled."
p334_311,The whole nation will be delighted.
p334_312,The public have been very supportive.
p334_313,"We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?"
p334_314,"No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different."
p334_315,The hotel was now for sale.
p334_316,There are two games to go after that.
p334_317,It seems a little short to me.
p334_318,"Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn."
p334_319,It's ahead of Labour.
p334_320,"His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald."
p334_321,I welcome this new service.
p334_322,Then it developed into civil and criminal.
p334_323,She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
p334_324,"Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull."
p334_325,It was a UK-wide report.
p334_326,The law should be changed.
p334_327,This is a dreadful day for Iona.
p334_328,"He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country."
p334_329,I will be standing.
p334_330,"Lara is very, very much a girl."
p334_331,It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p334_332,Are you from the rugby?
p334_333,The attack was totally unprovoked.
p334_334,The plot is simple.
p334_335,They've not let anyone into the loop.
p334_336,So just what is her enduring appeal?
p334_337,With actors it is slightly different.
p334_338,"I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react."
p334_339,Last night was a key episode.
p334_340,What did we learn?
p334_341,Looking at him is proof of the pudding.
p334_342,I knew he was dying.
p334_343,He's a key player in Scotland.
p334_344,He loved his children.
p334_345,She wondered why we were interested.
p334_346,The story was being repeated across Scotland.
p334_347,An appeal was made to the presiding officer.
p334_348,I am content with the silver.
p334_349,People acted too quickly.
p334_350,"This, too, could provoke a risky business."
p334_351,We took the chances when they came.
p334_352,You have to audition for jobs.
p334_353,What would you do if you didn't work?
p334_354,Ferguson should take note.
p334_355,"We have always been, and remain confident of the securing of order."
p334_356,Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p334_357,The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p334_358,They've got three-quarters of the way.
p334_359,It gave no further details.
p334_360,This man is serious about his work.
p334_361,"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling."
p334_362,She was released from hospital yesterday.
p334_363,"Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all."
p334_364,It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p334_365,The move follows a review of the Singapore
p334_366,We will miss him very much.
p334_367,This was a chilling echo.
p334_368,"As a nation, we must become more active."
p334_369,This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p334_370,"It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years."
p334_371,January is a bad time of year.
p334_372,Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p334_373,Liberal Democrat leader makes the hash of it.
p334_374,They are a very powerful and tasty side.
p334_375,This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p334_376,I'm delighted for Simon.
p334_377,His third goal was superb.
p334_378,Here we have not had one hour.
p334_379,"He said to me, Which one, son?"
p334_380,I don't have a problem with getting older.
p334_381,His son is a local legend.
p334_382,I was so nervous.
p334_383,The attacker has been put in foster care.
p334_384,His death was a tragic accident.
p334_385,It's to do with context.
p334_386,This fight is not going to go away.
p334_387,"At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing."
p334_388,I just don't know where he is.
p334_389,Would you take them?
p334_390,I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p334_391,Golf is an expensive game for beginners.
p334_392,He would take up the bike.
p334_393,"A world away from Rangers, you might say."
p334_394,He sat down at the piano.
p334_395,His condition was stable last night.
p334_396,The sun is worth a million dollars.
p334_397,Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p334_398,I'm sure they love it.
p334_399,I'd never seen a play about me.
p334_400,The track is currently covered in snow.
p334_401,And they all had these other commitments.
p334_402,The report is due out next month.
p334_403,It was nerve-racking to watch.
p334_404,We are going to change our party.
p334_405,It's the same as Glasgow.
p334_406,This seems like a very good idea.
p334_407,My wife and family are the support system.
