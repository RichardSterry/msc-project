p299_001,Please call Stella.
p299_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p299_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p299_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p299_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p299_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p299_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p299_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p299_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p299_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p299_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p299_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p299_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p299_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p299_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p299_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p299_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p299_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p299_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p299_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p299_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p299_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p299_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p299_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p299_025,I just went for it over the weekend.
p299_026,I managed to take her completely by surprise.
p299_027,"It is only one night, after all."
p299_028,Gilbert was not amused.
p299_029,My first season in Scotland was fantastic.
p299_030,"I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice."
p299_031,It has moved on in the last week.
p299_032,It's easy to see why.
p299_033,I am proud of moments like that.
p299_034,This is a totally different order of agreement.
p299_035,Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p299_036,"He was arrested, but later released without charge."
p299_037,Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p299_038,This is a big advantage.
p299_039,I think we have a very strong case.
p299_040,We agreed to disagree.
p299_041,"If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment."
p299_042,If you look at the beginning of Alien.
p299_043,I've learned from my mistakes.
p299_044,Today is not about contracts.
p299_045,"It should be a great game, though."
p299_046,That says something for his strength of character.
p299_047,"You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals."
p299_048,It's to do with play.
p299_049,"Usually, you should leave it alone in the box."
p299_050,I've just got to do this.
p299_051,Rangers will have a massive support in Glasgow.
p299_052,That was the problem.
p299_053,Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
p299_054,I have been here for only three months.
p299_055,Everything else is second.
p299_056,I think it is a sensible change.
p299_057,Sex is fun?
p299_058,"They were not doing it too well, either."
p299_059,"He added, It's not a racial problem."
p299_060,He had played well in that central role.
p299_061,We hope this scheme will change that.
p299_062,It was created by genocide.
p299_063,"It was, for me, like a week in heaven."
p299_064,How could anyone take issue with that?
p299_065,He takes time out for everyone.
p299_066,The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p299_067,"Now, just two games into the season, he has gone."
p299_068,A number of people could not speak English.
p299_069,They have got off with murder.
p299_070,They had had time for little else.
p299_071,Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p299_072,We have reports of this throughout Scotland.

p299_074,The settlement could run to millions.
p299_075,It does not stop at the border.
p299_076,"We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect."
p299_077,How can they say that?
p299_078,Robert is a special talent.
p299_079,"John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint."
p299_080,"She added, It is a huge problem."
p299_081,You can't keep them separate.
p299_082,I still feel like a wee boy.
p299_083,He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.

p299_090,"For one veteran, the memories remain vivid."
p299_091,There is a growing anger among the group.

p299_101,It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
p299_102,This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p299_103,He had a heart problem.
p299_104,The breakdown was much later in her life.
p299_105,"I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role."
p299_106,That was the light relief.
p299_107,I am a wealthy person.
p299_108,He has one son and one daughter.

p299_113,He had other things on his mind.

p299_122,They married in August last year.
p299_123,"However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks."
p299_124,Yet he chose to do something different.
p299_125,"He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy."
p299_126,There were no casualties.
p299_127,I've just got to build on this now.

p299_145,This has a number of benefits.
p299_146,There is too much at stake for that.
p299_147,That is in the very nature of farming.
p299_148,These matters are now behind us.
