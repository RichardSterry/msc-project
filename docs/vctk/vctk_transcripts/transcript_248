p248_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p248_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p248_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p248_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p248_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p248_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p248_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p248_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p248_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p248_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p248_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p248_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p248_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p248_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p248_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p248_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p248_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p248_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p248_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p248_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p248_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p248_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p248_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p248_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p248_025,"She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
"
p248_026,"It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
"
p248_027,"But it failed.
"
p248_028,"That's no bad thing.
"
p248_029,"The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
"
p248_030,"I have a theory.
"
p248_031,"Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
"
p248_032,"I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
"
p248_033,"They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
"
p248_034,"Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
"
p248_035,"I expected these kind of questions.
"
p248_036,"It's a matter of balance.
"
p248_037,"We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
"
p248_038,"But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
"
p248_039,"It was clear.
"
p248_040,"People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
"
p248_041,"She is believed to be in South Africa.
"
p248_042,"I was scared.
"
p248_043,"It was ugly.
"
p248_044,"That is a break with tradition.
"
p248_045,"You must always attempt to raise the bar.
"
p248_046,"No meaningful response was issued.
"
p248_047,"It is urgent.
"
p248_048,"Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
"
p248_049,"The record companies have gone through the floor.
"
p248_050,"We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
"
p248_051,"But it might have done.
"
p248_052,"In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
"
p248_053,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p248_054,"They had to explain it.
"
p248_055,"Here's a clue.
"
p248_056,"But the law is very clear on this.
"
p248_057,"Next league matches Celtic.
"
p248_058,"It's very odd.
"
p248_059,"It will take time.
"
p248_060,"The problems are a result of that shortfall.
"
p248_061,"We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
"
p248_062,"Four other charges were dropped.
"
p248_063,"It is not great art.
"
p248_064,"It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
"
p248_065,"Scotland had great assets.
"
p248_066,"There will be tough opponents to this report.
"
p248_067,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p248_068,"It's good news and long overdue.
"
p248_069,"Have a look at our accounts.
"
p248_070,"He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
"
p248_071,"There was an e-mail.
"
p248_072,"Then followed a bout of flu.
"
p248_073,"Neither it is.
"
p248_074,"I had my suspicions.
"
p248_075,"He got the same story.
"
p248_076,"It works for us.
"
p248_077,"It is a time bomb.
"
p248_078,"Today she has been released.
"
p248_079,"It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
"
p248_080,"It may well have been.
"
p248_081,"That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
"
p248_082,"Nothing is yet confirmed.
"
p248_083,"New Zealand rugby is totally different.
"
p248_084,"We have other options.
"
p248_085,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p248_086,"It's never too late.
"
p248_087,"Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
"
p248_088,"Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
"
p248_089,"They lived for their children.
"
p248_090,"Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
"
p248_091,"This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
"
p248_092,"I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
"
p248_093,"He was possessed
"
p248_094,"I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
"
p248_095,"Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
"
p248_096,"It is a delight on every level.
"
p248_097,"I had a ball today.
"
p248_098,"Two of the team became ill.
"
p248_099,"That's all right then.
"
p248_100,"That would be unlawful.
"
p248_101,"That time is not now, however.
"
p248_102,"Oil embargo endorsed.
"
p248_103,"I didn't play well last year.
"
p248_104,"That is no use.
"
p248_105,"That all hope is never lost.
"
p248_106,"Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
"
p248_107,"He pleaded for caution.
"
p248_108,"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
"
p248_109,"I thought it was a fantastic game.
"
p248_110,"It had been played at festivals.
"
p248_111,"We do not expect any surplus.
"
p248_112,"Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
"
p248_113,"Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
"
p248_114,"It's not a new concept in jazz.
"
p248_115,"This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
"
p248_116,"Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
"
p248_117,"Maybe this battle has been.
"
p248_118,"But the fans deserve to know!
"
p248_119,"Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
"
p248_120,"They've got to account for it.
"
p248_121,"She's got to say something.
"
p248_122,"Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
"
p248_123,"We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
"
p248_124,"I can't even get into the A team.
"
p248_125,"She does not want to speak.
"
p248_126,"It's terrible that he has died the same way.
"
p248_127,"So the European elections are extremely important.
"
p248_128,"Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
"
p248_129,"Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
"
p248_130,"I had relied on him.
"
p248_131,"The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
"
p248_132,"It's the big omission.
"
p248_133,"It plans to return to this field.
"
p248_134,"Our intentions are real.
"
p248_135,"Government will intervene.
"
p248_136,"Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
"
p248_137,"Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
"
p248_138,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p248_139,"It was typical.
"
p248_140,"I was the last man to touch the ball.
"
p248_141,"He has the edge.
"
p248_142,"He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
"
p248_143,"It's a crucial award.
"
p248_144,"He is severe.
"
p248_145,"There is a lack of chemistry.
"
p248_146,"This film will be totally awesome.
"
p248_147,"That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
"
p248_148,"It is like a football team.
"
p248_149,"Last month he made his debut in Japan.
"
p248_150,"It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
"
p248_151,"It is huge.
"
p248_152,"The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
"
p248_153,"The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
"
p248_154,"It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
"
p248_155,"They were later discharged from hospital.
"
p248_156,"That includes the equipment?
"
p248_157,"They should stop the bombing.
"
p248_158,"That's the name of the game, though.
"
p248_159,"A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
"
p248_160,"They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
"
p248_161,"Eight months later, he was dead.
"
p248_162,"It has to be now.
"
p248_163,"It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
"
p248_164,"I was in the train station overnight.
"
p248_165,"We knew we had the goal we wanted.
"
p248_166,"It's that sort of night.
"
p248_167,"We have a budget in March.
"
p248_168,"By then, however, both men were already in the US.
"
p248_169,"The post will be unpaid.
"
p248_170,"Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
"
p248_171,"Waiting times for these services are too long.
"
p248_172,"They thought they had found a home.
"
p248_173,"You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
"
p248_174,"The jury is still out.
"
p248_175,"Blair's response was weak.
"
p248_176,"IT S the real thing, for sure.
"
p248_177,"And I saw the light!
"
p248_178,"There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
"
p248_179,"Tony had arrived.
"
p248_180,"I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
"
p248_181,"The goals were good.
"
p248_182,"I've been there.
"
p248_183,"Four policemen were wounded.
"
p248_184,"They receive a high profile in the media.
"
p248_185,"We did everything by the book.
"
p248_186,"They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
"
p248_187,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p248_188,"What has caused the demise of singing?
"
p248_189,"You know the sort of thing.
"
p248_190,"I cannot say too much about them.
"
p248_191,"It was an odd affair, in many respects.
"
p248_192,"All options are open.
"
p248_193,"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
"
p248_194,"However, this idea is never developed.
"
p248_195,"It wasn't to be.
"
p248_196,"It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
"
p248_197,"It's the same old story.
"
p248_198,"It was still there, but right at the end.
"
p248_199,"There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
"
p248_200,"The service from the other players was super.
"
p248_201,"The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
"
p248_202,"But she might be.
"
p248_203,"It's just awful.
"
p248_204,"Today was first class.
"
p248_205,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p248_206,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p248_207,"Now, it's all right.
"
p248_208,"This gives a financial incentive to switch.
"
p248_209,"The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
"
p248_210,"HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
"
p248_211,"He is slightly confused.
"
p248_212,"The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
"
p248_213,"Twaddle is a case in point.
"
p248_214,"It had all been arranged.
"
p248_215,"In each case they were a goal down.
"
p248_216,"I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
"
p248_217,"The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
"
p248_218,"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
"
p248_219,"He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
"
p248_220,"Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
"
p248_221,"Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
"
p248_222,"A career as a doctor is on hold.
"
p248_223,"I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
"
p248_224,"It was good fun.
"
p248_225,"I have spoken to the skipper.
"
p248_226,"It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
"
p248_227,"The track is currently covered in snow.
"
p248_228,"But he failed to win the committee's support.
"
p248_229,"At the time, he was a living legend.
"
p248_230,"It's the same as Glasgow.
"
p248_231,"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
"
p248_232,"Police later said the scheme would end in November.
"
p248_233,"It is set in Paris.
"
p248_234,"They should come forward.
"
p248_235,"I haven't made the donation yet.
"
p248_236,"It's very safe.
"
p248_237,"It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
"
p248_238,"On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
"
p248_239,"It is no surprise.
"
p248_240,"My future is in the marathon.
"
p248_241,"We have a free vote on these things in our party.
"
p248_242,"I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
"
p248_243,"She is well balanced.
"
p248_244,"A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
"
p248_245,"It is hard won.
"
p248_246,"The scene is about this?
"
p248_247,"The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
"
p248_248,"It's a record label, not a form of music.
"
p248_249,"It was a cry for help.
"
p248_250,"It was a hit.
"
p248_251,"This year I understood.
"
p248_252,"I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
"
p248_253,"At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
"
p248_254,"We run within the law.
"
p248_255,"Kirkwood was arrested.
"
p248_256,"they fail to engage.
"
p248_257,"They are real.
"
p248_258,"They must play for each other.
"
p248_259,"However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
"
p248_260,"It is also very valuable.
"
p248_261,"An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
"
p248_262,"That is highly unfair.
"
p248_263,"He will emerge as a world leader.
"
p248_264,"They want to shut the Scottish Office.
"
p248_265,"This is a question of Islam.
"
p248_266,"Of course, that is not the whole story.
"
p248_267,"Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
"
p248_268,"I am totally horrified by the sentence.
"
p248_269,"Immediate action must be taken.
"
p248_270,"He is a young man with a new deal.
"
p248_271,"He was also married with two children.
"
p248_272,"He's been here on numerous occasions.
"
p248_273,"It's a way of life.
"
p248_274,"I feel pretty good.
"
p248_275,"Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
"
p248_276,"If not, he should go home.
"
p248_277,"He looked very sharp.
"
p248_278,"This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
"
p248_279,"You've got to have both sides.
"
p248_280,"What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
"
p248_281,"He will address the nation this evening.
"
p248_282,"It was a virus.
"
p248_283,"Maloney is an engaging talent.
"
p248_284,"It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
"
p248_285,"It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
"
p248_286,"But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
"
p248_287,"It is not normal practice.
"
p248_288,"The release attracted little attention.
"
p248_289,"The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
"
p248_290,"IT S all in the hair.
"
p248_291,"What has altered?
"
p248_292,"I thought it was my only chance.
"
p248_293,"The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
"
p248_294,"Our task is to complete the picture.
"
p248_295,"Davis is very supportive, as a director.
"
p248_296,"We believe the world has too many refugees already.
"
p248_297,"We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
"
p248_298,"In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
"
p248_299,"SCOTLAND has shown the way.
"
p248_300,"It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
"
p248_301,"However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
"
p248_302,"Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
"
p248_303,"The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
"
p248_304,"We have waited a long time for this.
"
p248_305,"and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
"
p248_306,"It's about my time as a guitarist.
"
p248_307,"It should be equal.
"
p248_308,"Craig is a major concern for us.
"
p248_309,"He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
"
p248_310,"The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
"
p248_311,"Other people had looked at it.
"
p248_312,"They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
"
p248_313,"Off with their heads.
"
p248_314,"The parents will have a great time, too.
"
p248_315,"Donald was his friend.
"
p248_316,"I think I was recorded with a video camera.
"
p248_317,"He was unable to come.
"
p248_318,"I saw some good things.
"
p248_319,"It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
"
p248_320,"You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
"
p248_321,"Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
"
p248_322,"Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
"
p248_323,"Who will do it?
"
p248_324,"That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
"
p248_325,"I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
"
p248_326,"This is the way things should be handled.
"
p248_327,"The train was on time.
"
p248_328,"You were very proud that day to be among their friends.
"
p248_329,"He has to learn.
"
p248_330,"Indeed, it was magical.
"
p248_331,"There's no place to hide.
"
p248_332,"It will be very, very tight.
"
p248_333,"I said that I had been raped.
"
p248_334,"In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
"
p248_335,"The composer will conduct.
"
p248_336,"This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
"
p248_337,"Like his acting, it was an accident.
"
p248_338,"Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
"
p248_339,"It's the last thing on my mind.
"
p248_340,"The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
"
p248_341,"I'd like to take the plunge.
"
p248_342,"Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
"
p248_343,"It is horrible.
"
p248_344,"They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
"
p248_345,"I kept going for her.
"
p248_346,"Tyson is overwhelmed.
"
p248_347,"In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
"
p248_348,"But nothing happened.
"
