p288_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p288_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p288_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p288_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p288_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p288_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p288_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p288_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p288_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p288_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p288_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p288_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p288_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p288_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p288_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p288_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p288_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p288_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p288_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p288_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p288_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p288_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p288_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p288_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p288_025,"She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
"
p288_026,"It is a disaster area.
"
p288_027,"Is this accurate?
"
p288_028,"However, the following year the cancer returned.
"
p288_029,"Because we do not need it.
"
p288_030,"I was an athlete.
"
p288_031,"It is a case of taking a risk.
"
p288_032,"We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
"
p288_033,"I think a move would create a lot of interest.
"
p288_034,"It was fit for royalty.
"
p288_035,"Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
"
p288_036,"President Bush is at war.
"
p288_037,"That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
"
p288_038,"I was scared.
"
p288_039,"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
"
p288_040,"But it took a lot of bottle.
"
p288_041,"Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
"
p288_042,"We need to chat.
"
p288_043,"But it might have done.
"
p288_044,"Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
"
p288_045,"He is too weak to move.
"
p288_046,"Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
"
p288_047,"He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
"
p288_048,"It will come all right.
"
p288_049,"I was lost.
"
p288_050,"I guess I was lucky, though.
"
p288_051,"I was inspired by two things.
"
p288_052,"Sadly, it can't.
"
p288_053,"It's very odd.
"
p288_054,"It is unique.
"
p288_055,"It will take time.
"
p288_056,"That's the truth.
"
p288_057,"The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
"
p288_058,"The problems are a result of that shortfall.
"
p288_059,"Four other charges were dropped.
"
p288_060,"Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
"
p288_061,"They're appalled by that.
"
p288_062,"Scotland had great assets.
"
p288_063,"Equity declined to comment.
"
p288_064,"We should have known.
"
p288_065,"The end result is precisely the same.
"
p288_066,"Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
"
p288_067,"There is an element of racism in Scotland.
"
p288_068,"That was the easy election.
"
p288_069,"IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
"
p288_070,"Neither it is.
"
p288_071,"He seemed to lose his focus.
"
p288_072,"It can be halted.
"
p288_073,"It was chaotic.
"
p288_074,"Is there a new way forward?
"
p288_075,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p288_076,"I've not thought about it.
"
p288_077,"People must remain vigilant.
"
p288_078,"This is the way things should be handled.
"
p288_079,"Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
"
p288_080,"It's all going to clear the debt.
"
p288_081,"Last week, he was taken into hospital.
"
p288_082,"Nothing is yet confirmed.
"
p288_083,"New Zealand rugby is totally different.
"
p288_084,"We have other options.
"
p288_085,"When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
"
p288_086,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p288_087,"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
"
p288_088,"Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
"
p288_089,"Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
"
p288_090,"It is a lifeline.
"
p288_091,"That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
"
p288_092,"Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
"
p288_093,"They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
"
p288_094,"Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
"
p288_095,"Journalists should make him.
"
p288_096,"It was a good performance.
"
p288_097,"Here, again, they were denied a voice.
"
p288_098,"I didn't play well last year.
"
p288_099,"It was an adventure.
"
p288_100,"I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
"
p288_101,"I'm not depressed.
"
p288_102,"He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
"
p288_103,"It's in his blood.
"
p288_104,"It had been played at festivals.
"
p288_105,"We do not expect any surplus.
"
p288_106,"It is so sad.
"
p288_107,"They were behind the wheel.
"
p288_108,"The fire was above the hole.
"
p288_109,"We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
"
p288_110,"On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
"
p288_111,"It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
"
p288_112,"Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
"
p288_113,"It is rubbish.
"
p288_114,"This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
"
p288_115,"An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
"
p288_116,"That's all right then.
"
p288_117,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p288_118,"It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
"
p288_119,"It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
"
p288_120,"I'm so angry.
"
p288_121,"It has removed a bit of guilt.
"
p288_122,"So the European elections are extremely important.
"
p288_123,"The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
"
p288_124,"Well, you can have a tree.
"
p288_125,"I had relied on him.
"
p288_126,"You've got to be vigilant.
"
p288_127,"The goals were good.
"
p288_128,"We never said that we would walk through the third division.
"
p288_129,"We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
"
p288_130,"If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
"
p288_131,"And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
"
p288_132,"We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
"
p288_133,"Is that Titanic?
"
p288_134,"He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
"
p288_135,"Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
"
p288_136,"Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
"
p288_137,"It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
"
p288_138,"He should have won.
"
p288_139,"The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
"
p288_140,"The selection process is still at a very early stage.
"
p288_141,"The weather forecast isn't good.
"
p288_142,"A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
"
p288_143,"Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
"
p288_144,"That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
"
p288_145,"She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
"
p288_146,"Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
"
p288_147,"They were later discharged from hospital.
"
p288_148,"This latter point is hugely important.
"
p288_149,"Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
"
p288_150,"It was so new, so exciting.
"
p288_151,"I'm just enjoying every match.
"
p288_152,"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
"
p288_153,"It has to be now.
"
p288_154,"I was in the train station overnight.
"
p288_155,"Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
"
p288_156,"We knew we had the goal we wanted.
"
p288_157,"I have got a wife to feed.
"
p288_158,"It is not too late to get on board.
"
p288_159,"They will do their own thing.
"
p288_160,"Does that put pressure on us?
"
p288_161,"Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
"
p288_162,"It is too much for me.
"
p288_163,"It is a terrible place.
"
p288_164,"And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
"
p288_165,"Nobody did in those days.
"
p288_166,"It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
"
p288_167,"He was a crazy man.
"
p288_168,"They thought they had found a home.
"
p288_169,"The jury is still out.
"
p288_170,"It's quite a routine.
"
p288_171,"It should be easy.
"
p288_172,"In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
"
p288_173,"Tony had arrived.
"
p288_174,"Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
"
p288_175,"There is no point in looking any further.
"
p288_176,"Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
"
p288_177,"It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
"
p288_178,"Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
"
p288_179,"It's a joke.
"
p288_180,"It just came into my head that day.
"
p288_181,"They really did a great job.
"
p288_182,"It is tough, but possible.
"
p288_183,"It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
"
p288_184,"People will ask about us.
"
p288_185,"If the director is with you.
"
p288_186,"It's very difficult to find a buyer.
"
p288_187,"We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
"
p288_188,"The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
"
p288_189,"Peace was won.
"
p288_190,"It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
"
p288_191,"I wanted to put myself on the line.
"
p288_192,"It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
"
p288_193,"It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
"
p288_194,"The conference is the first test.
"
p288_195,"Is that success?
"
p288_196,"But we are not immune to the problem.
"
p288_197,"They are in the euro.
"
p288_198,"I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
"
p288_199,"But she might be.
"
p288_200,"It's all about money, money, money.
"
p288_201,"Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
"
p288_202,"After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
"
p288_203,"Now, it's all right.
"
p288_204,"This gives a financial incentive to switch.
"
p288_205,"Saddam Hussein is a devil.
"
p288_206,"Feel the heat?
"
p288_207,"She should not be blamed.
"
p288_208,"Twaddle is a case in point.
"
p288_209,"It had all been arranged.
"
p288_210,"The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
"
p288_211,"In each case they were a goal down.
"
p288_212,"I was so nervous.
"
p288_213,"However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
"
p288_214,"The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
"
p288_215,"He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
"
p288_216,"Who was on the panel?
"
p288_217,"A career as a doctor is on hold.
"
p288_218,"We've got the bronze.
"
p288_219,"Mental health is a massive issue.
"
p288_220,"You have to do your research.
"
p288_221,"We played them off the pitch.
"
p288_222,"But it will be sorted out this week.
"
p288_223,"It was good fun.
"
p288_224,"It's a question of creating a future awareness.
"
p288_225,"I'd never seen a play about me.
"
p288_226,"It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
"
p288_227,"The track is currently covered in snow.
"
p288_228,"The body follows the mind.
"
p288_229,"However, no further action was taken by police.
"
p288_230,"She hopes to study in Britain one day.
"
p288_231,"It is set in Paris.
"
p288_232,"Half of young people had had contact with the police.
"
p288_233,"I haven't made the donation yet.
"
p288_234,"And a film maker was born.
"
p288_235,"On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
"
p288_236,"Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
"
p288_237,"We have a free vote on these things in our party.
"
p288_238,"He's got to go.
"
p288_239,"He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
"
p288_240,"It's too much work.
"
p288_241,"It would appear that it has not been a problem.
"
p288_242,"A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
"
p288_243,"It is hard won.
"
p288_244,"Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
"
p288_245,"In fact, we were all over the shop.
"
p288_246,"He's a lovely young man.
"
p288_247,"A friendship that will endure.
"
p288_248,"He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
"
p288_249,"I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
"
p288_250,"Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
"
p288_251,"I told you I was ill.
"
p288_252,"It's a source of deep concern.
"
p288_253,"This is a big club.
"
p288_254,"It is very important that we get the balance right.
"
p288_255,"One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
"
p288_256,"I was happily surprised.
"
p288_257,"The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
"
p288_258,"Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
"
p288_259,"George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
"
p288_260,"Blood samples were taken.
"
p288_261,"We shall rely on human beings.
"
p288_262,"This is a question of Islam.
"
p288_263,"It looks as though he will be right.
"
p288_264,"The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
"
p288_265,"He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
"
p288_266,"Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
"
p288_267,"We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
"
p288_268,"And Michael was just great.
"
p288_269,"It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
"
p288_270,"In fact, they have the opposite effect.
"
p288_271,"Our objective is to tackle poverty.
"
p288_272,"A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
"
p288_273,"He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
"
p288_274,"I am an estate agent.
"
p288_275,"In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
"
p288_276,"It happens from time to time.
"
p288_277,"But I've won both ways.
"
p288_278,"This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
"
p288_279,"You've got to have both sides.
"
p288_280,"He will address the nation this evening.
"
p288_281,"The attacker died in the crash.
"
p288_282,"Maloney is an engaging talent.
"
p288_283,"Who will perform?
"
p288_284,"It's like a high school play.
"
p288_285,"The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
"
p288_286,"This is a national crisis.
"
p288_287,"The death toll included five children.
"
p288_288,"Who did the recruiting?
"
p288_289,"So I did.
"
p288_290,"The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
"
p288_291,"Sunday's game was not a trial.
"
p288_292,"Who can predict?
"
p288_293,"I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
"
p288_294,"The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
"
p288_295,"We have to sort it out ourselves.
"
p288_296,"That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
"
p288_297,"The home was now under new management.
"
p288_298,"I thought it was my only chance.
"
p288_299,"However, the snow was welcomed by some.
"
p288_300,"Nothing is safe.
"
p288_301,"One was a lawyer.
"
p288_302,"The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
"
p288_303,"We believe the world has too many refugees already.
"
p288_304,"Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
"
p288_305,"In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
"
p288_306,"It's just not funny!
"
p288_307,"I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
"
p288_308,"SCOTLAND has shown the way.
"
p288_309,"It's certainly different.
"
p288_310,"O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
"
p288_311,"We want to play at the worlds.
"
p288_312,"He was solid.
"
p288_313,"This is the culture change in medicine.
"
p288_314,"and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
"
p288_315,"There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
"
p288_316,"I never thought it would take this long.
"
p288_317,"My whole life has changed.
"
p288_318,"They wanted the club to make money.
"
p288_319,"Hartley should know.
"
p288_320,"Kids are terrible.
"
p288_321,"The home team had an amazing start.
"
p288_322,"My body is clearly capable.
"
p288_323,"For the moment, our position remains the same.
"
p288_324,"I had my suspicions.
"
p288_325,"However, the groups denied the claims.
"
p288_326,"There was some merit in that.
"
p288_327,"I came into this world with nothing.
"
p288_328,"In his absence, the council adopted the change.
"
p288_329,"The figures are bad, but not that bad.
"
p288_330,"They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
"
p288_331,"We agreed to disagree.
"
p288_332,"He was then replaced by Ross.
"
p288_333,"Donald was his friend.
"
p288_334,"I'd like to take the plunge.
"
p288_335,"She did not attend the courtroom.
"
p288_336,"Finally, he paid for the movie.
"
p288_337,"You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
"
p288_338,"The same things will happen with GM foods.
"
p288_339,"In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
"
p288_340,"I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
"
p288_341,"I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
"
p288_342,"These days are long gone.
"
p288_343,"He's been the key to everything.
"
p288_344,"The boat was fantastic.
"
p288_345,"A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
"
p288_346,"I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
"
p288_347,"It was good for us that they lost that day.
"
p288_348,"A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
"
