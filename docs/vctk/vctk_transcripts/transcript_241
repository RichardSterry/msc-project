p241_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p241_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p241_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p241_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p241_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p241_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p241_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p241_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p241_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p241_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p241_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p241_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p241_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p241_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p241_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p241_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p241_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p241_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p241_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p241_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p241_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p241_025,"She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
"
p241_026,"He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
"
p241_027,"We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
"
p241_028,"I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
"
p241_029,"However, the following year the cancer returned.
"
p241_030,"Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
"
p241_031,"They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
"
p241_032,"This is the window.
"
p241_033,"People love to see this stuff.
"
p241_034,"And we have a singer.
"
p241_035,"He took me on a tour of the wards.
"
p241_036,"IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
"
p241_037,"It's nice to hear.
"
p241_038,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p241_039,"It is not for any other purpose.
"
p241_040,"President Bush is at war.
"
p241_041,"It was ugly.
"
p241_042,"You must always attempt to raise the bar.
"
p241_043,"That period was a struggle.
"
p241_044,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p241_045,"We need to chat.
"
p241_046,"That time has passed.
"
p241_047,"As she explains.
"
p241_048,"He is too weak to move.
"
p241_049,"He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
"
p241_050,"In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
"
p241_051,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p241_052,"We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
"
p241_053,"However the drama was still not at an end.
"
p241_055,"Next league matches Celtic.
"
p241_056,"Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
"
p241_057,"What was the main difference?
"
p241_058,"I was an athlete.
"
p241_059,"There was a battle there.
"
p241_061,"It was all in a short period of time.
"
p241_062,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p241_063,"Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
"
p241_064,"The script was funny.
"
p241_065,"He could make it.
"
p241_066,"Try to save us.
"
p241_067,"Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
"
p241_068,"There is an element of racism in Scotland.
"
p241_069,"I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
"
p241_070,"The company yesterday refused to comment.
"
p241_071,"He highlighted a lack of staff.
"
p241_072,"They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
"
p241_073,"Both sides have been hit by injury.
"
p241_074,"The girls are so lucky to be alive.
"
p241_075,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p241_076,"He is now resident in England.
"
p241_077,"Even the one she loved.
"
p241_078,"I've got the shirt.
"
p241_079,"This is the way things should be handled.
"
p241_080,"Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
"
p241_081,"That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
"
p241_082,"I first met him last summer.
"
p241_083,"Nothing is yet confirmed.
"
p241_084,"Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
"
p241_085,"Someone who cares
"
p241_087,"Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
"
p241_088,"And rugby fans can help.
"
p241_089,"They have not done so this season so far.
"
p241_090,"The city council is a major property owner in the area.
"
p241_091,"Now the system is right behind us.
"
p241_092,"Today I couldn't run on it.
"
p241_093,"A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
"
p241_094,"Motherwell have no such good fortune.
"
p241_095,"That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
"
p241_096,"The peace process will be buried!
"
p241_098,"I love the Dome.
"
p241_099,"They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
"
p241_100,"It was mayhem.
"
p241_101,"A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
"
p241_102,"Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
"
p241_103,"We want to get to the final, anyway.
"
p241_104,"They will want to perform well.
"
p241_105,"Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
"
p241_106,"I'm not depressed.
"
p241_107,"It was his job to check.
"
p241_108,"Is that right?
"
p241_109,"You had better believe it.
"
p241_110,"We want to help them through it.
"
p241_111,"It's not a new concept in jazz.
"
p241_112,"The breakdown was much later in her life.
"
p241_113,"It's not fair.
"
p241_114,"We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
"
p241_115,"He will emerge as a world leader.
"
p241_116,"I'm delighted about that.
"
p241_117,"I joined a group.
"
p241_118,"There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.

p241_124,"It has removed a bit of guilt.
"
p241_125,"His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
"
p241_126,"They keep the atmosphere in mind.
"
p241_127,"It's terrible that he has died the same way.
"

"
p241_129,"Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
"
p241_130,"The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
"
p241_132,"What will happen then?
"
p241_133,"It's not true.
"
p241_134,"Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
"
p241_135,"Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
"
p241_136,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.

"
p241_141,"The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
"
p241_142,"He is severe.
"
p241_143,"Is that Titanic?
"
p241_144,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p241_145,"I am just trying to do my job.
"
p241_146,"It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
"
p241_147,"The home side didn't stand a chance.
"
p241_148,"The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
"
p241_149,"We want to see the maximum of change.
"
p241_150,"The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
"
p241_151,"We also enjoyed a lot of support.
"
p241_152,"They were later discharged from hospital.
"
p241_153,"Neither side can win this war.
"
p241_154,"Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
"
p241_155,"Was this element always there?
"
p241_157,"It was so new, so exciting.
"
p241_158,"But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
"
p241_159,"I've put my own money into this project.
"
p241_160,"We do not get that impression now.
"
p241_161,"Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
"
p241_162,"We have to move forward.
"
p241_163,"Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
"
p241_164,"We have a budget in March.
"
p241_165,"There was no respite.
"
p241_166,"They will do their own thing.
"
p241_167,"The post will be unpaid.
"
p241_168,"Waiting times for these services are too long.
"
p241_169,"It is too much for me.
"
p241_170,"He was a crazy man.
"
p241_171,"A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
"
p241_172,"It became a book by itself.
"
p241_173,"One season, they might do well.
"
p241_174,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p241_175,"And I saw the light!
"
p241_176,"He asked me in a tolerance zone.
"
p241_177,"The clarity is vital.
"
p241_178,"I drove the ball well.
"
p241_179,"No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
"
p241_180,"They know no other way.
"
p241_181,"It is minute.
"
p241_182,"They will run a mile.
"
p241_183,"Four policemen were wounded.
"
p241_184,"We did everything by the book.
"
p241_185,"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
"
p241_186,"What has caused the demise of singing?
"
p241_187,"The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
"
p241_188,"I wish I could say something.
"
p241_189,"We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
"
p241_190,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p241_191,"The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
"
p241_192,"I wanted to put myself on the line.
"
p241_193,"Off I went.
"
p241_195,"It's the same old story.
"
p241_196,"It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
"
p241_197,"Is that success?
"
p241_198,"He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
"
p241_199,"On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
"
p241_200,"The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
"
p241_202,"I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
"
p241_203,"He's not perfect.
"
p241_204,"They've got three-quarters of the way.
"
p241_205,"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
"
p241_206,"We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
"
p241_207,"Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
"
p241_208,"I don't want to use it.
"
p241_209,"But I am a worried man.
"
p241_210,"He knows a lot.
"
p241_211,"It had all been arranged.
"
p241_212,"A Grampian Police spokesman said.
"
p241_213,"His third goal was superb.
"
p241_214,"It's been a good year.
"
p241_215,"We want to keep the pound.
"
p241_216,"I was so nervous.
"
p241_217,"A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
"
p241_218,"The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
"
p241_219,"IT S the real thing, for sure.
"
p241_220,"A career as a doctor is on hold.
"
p241_221,"You have to do your research.
"
p241_222,"At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
"
p241_223,"We played them off the pitch.
"
p241_224,"But it will be sorted out this week.
"
p241_225,"Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
"
p241_226,"My neighbours are horrified.
"
p241_227,"The track is currently covered in snow.
"
p241_228,"Who would be right?
"
p241_229,"It is set in Paris.
"
p241_230,"It is not the message alone.
"
p241_231,"Well, they were the unlucky ones.
"
p241_232,"Hospitals are for the ill.
"
p241_233,"The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
"
p241_234,"We have a free vote on these things in our party.
"
p241_235,"We were extremely poor.
"
p241_236,"He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
"
p241_237,"We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
"
p241_238,"It is hard won.
"
p241_239,"A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
"
p241_240,"Chambers said he would accept the place.
"
p241_241,"Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
"
p241_242,"In fact, we were all over the shop.
"
p241_243,"The scene is about this?
"
p241_244,"The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
"
p241_245,"In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
"
p241_246,"They are different types.
"
p241_247,"There will be widespread support on all sides.
"
p241_248,"He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
"
p241_249,"This is the culture change in medicine.
"
p241_250,"Her presence was almost everywhere.
"
p241_251,"He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
"
p241_252,"Special measures were needed.
"
p241_253,"That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
"
p241_254,"The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
"
p241_255,"It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
"
p241_256,"They are real.
"
p241_257,"This court has made an order which has not been observed.
"
p241_258,"Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
"
p241_259,"That's the only thing I will say.
"
p241_260,"It was good fun.
"
p241_261,"It looks as though he will be right.
"
p241_262,"Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
"
p241_264,"Immediate action must be taken.
"
p241_265,"It's very nice.
"
p241_266,"It left me with a sadness.
"
p241_267,"Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
"
p241_268,"And Michael was just great.
"
p241_269,"Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
"
p241_270,"Access has been a nightmare.
"
p241_271,"But he is caught between a rock and a hard place.
"
p241_272,"A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
"
p241_273,"Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
"
p241_274,"It was a privilege to work for him.
"
p241_275,"It's so awful.
"
p241_276,"It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
"
p241_277,"We are a grandmother.
"
p241_278,"We have to break that cycle.
"
p241_279,"I saw it at a ruck.
"
p241_280,"Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
"
p241_281,"But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
"
p241_282,"Yet, it worked.
"
p241_283,"I should think so, too.
"
p241_284,"It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
"
p241_285,"The death toll included five children.
"
p241_286,"A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
"
p241_287,"It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
"
p241_288,"It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
"
p241_289,"It changed my life.
"
p241_290,"A new school will be built.
"
p241_291,"I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
"
p241_292,"Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
"
p241_293,"That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
"
p241_294,"What has altered?
"
p241_295,"However, the snow was welcomed by some.
"
p241_296,"It just came into my head that day.
"
p241_297,"Our task is to complete the picture.
"
p241_298,"A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
"
p241_299,"Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
"
p241_300,"The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
"
p241_301,"This is a war over our home.
"
p241_302,"It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
"
p241_303,"The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
"
p241_304,"I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
"
p241_305,"And he goes with it.
"
p241_306,"SCOTLAND has shown the way.
"
p241_307,"Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
"
p241_308,"The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
"
p241_309,"Is there on his hands?
"
p241_310,"It was a question of patience.
"
p241_311,"I was rubbish.
"
p241_312,"Kids are terrible.
"
p241_313,"It should be equal.
"
p241_314,"Craig is a major concern for us.
"
p241_315,"The home team had an amazing start.
"
p241_317,"It is out there.
"
p241_319,"They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
"
p241_320,"We think all other measures are not exhausted.
"
p241_321,"In his absence, the council adopted the change.
"
p241_322,"It is a strong case.
"
p241_323,"They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
"
p241_324,"Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
"
p241_325,"I think I was recorded with a video camera.
"
p241_326,"We agreed to disagree.
"
p241_327,"I'd like to take the plunge.
"
p241_328,"My first concern is for the safety of the public.
"
p241_329,"I've not thought about it.
"
p241_330,"Who was the mystery MP?
"
p241_331,"It's been hard.
"
p241_332,"They should stop the bombing.
"
p241_333,"Who will do it?
"
p241_334,"However, Sharon rejected the claims.
"
p241_336,"I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
"
p241_337,"I must make that clear.
"
p241_338,"The train was on time.
"
p241_340,"They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
"
p241_342,"I would miss him.
"
p241_343,"Tiger is the exception.
"
p241_344,"I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
"
p241_345,"I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
"
p241_346,"His contract was then not renewed.
"
p241_347,"I got a yellow card.
"
p241_349,"A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
"
p241_350,"There is a cup final at stake.
"
p241_351,"Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
"
p241_352,"The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
"
p241_353,"In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
"
p241_354,"As, indeed, they would be.
"
p241_356,"It benefits the whole family.
"
p241_357,"Our numbers are small.
"
p241_358,"That would help.
"
p241_359,"So I left.
"
p241_360,"We are looking for perfection.
"
p241_362,"This is a club on the rise.
"
p241_363,"Equity declined to comment.
"
p241_364,"We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
"
p241_365,"The play is based on a real-life event.
"
p241_366,"He could face a jail sentence.
"
p241_368,"He put some colour into Scottish history.
"
p241_369,"There was no hint of scandal.
"
p241_370,"Safety was also an issue.
"
p241_371,"Well, the big day has arrived.
"
