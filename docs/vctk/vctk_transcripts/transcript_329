p329_001,Please call Stella.
p329_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p329_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p329_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p329_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p329_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p329_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p329_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p329_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p329_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p329_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p329_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p329_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p329_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p329_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p329_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p329_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p329_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p329_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p329_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p329_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p329_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p329_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p329_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p329_025,"But there has never been the time, she said."
p329_026,"This could be one such case, he declared."
p329_027,It's not a solo.
p329_028,The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p329_029,I fell in love with ballet.
p329_030,"That their music is truly, truly, truly great."
p329_031,I had found my vision.
p329_032,The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p329_033,"But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said."
p329_034,We don't know the scale of need.
p329_035,"Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment."
p329_036,We had a huge response to that campaign.
p329_037,"Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion."
p329_038,"I spoke with just one player, but not the others."
p329_039,We're still talking with a few people.
p329_040,We know you will not let us down.
p329_041,He will never walk the streets again.
p329_042,There are big names.
p329_043,That argument has been won.
p329_044,"Normally, they have been a pack of lies."
p329_045,I hope you will leave it at that.
p329_046,We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p329_047,The bill would be massive.
p329_048,He was just a journalist.
p329_049,"They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed."
p329_050,Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p329_051,I didn't have a clue.
p329_052,How can they engage with the work?
p329_053,I have been coming here for nine years.
p329_054,She has a wonderful mind.
p329_055,There are just two tournaments remaining.
p329_056,We're into that build-up now.
p329_057,It is the end of an era.
p329_058,I have had no social life at all.
p329_059,Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p329_060,"In short, the club was broke."
p329_061,His charisma is all on the course.
p329_062,I am still pretty young in this business.
p329_063,"On Saturday, it was much the same."
p329_064,We're not the tourist board.
p329_065,It was the same old story.
p329_066,"Apart from that, they would not be making any comment."
p329_067,The Commons is too outdated.
p329_068,"You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back."
p329_069,What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p329_070,"It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective."
p329_071,Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p329_072,"Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault."
p329_073,He would be with his peers.
p329_074,They seem to be backing off from that.
p329_075,This will be no easy option.
p329_076,"I wish they, too, would get a grip."
p329_077,I am so sorry.
p329_078,This avalanche is just beginning.
p329_079,"It is a pity, but you can't have everything."
p329_080,We will see how he is after treatment.
p329_081,I was there for five hours.
p329_082,But then he changed his mind.
p329_083,I don't know why she is not here.
p329_084,They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p329_085,There are no excuses.
p329_086,I feel very strongly about that.
p329_087,It is a difficult thing to explain.
p329_088,He just wants to play.
p329_089,It's very difficult and very worrying.
p329_090,Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
p329_091,I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p329_092,His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p329_093,I want to play at the highest level.
p329_094,Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
p329_095,It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p329_096,Jamming would be equally difficult.
p329_097,Drugs are always an issue.
p329_098,Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p329_099,This kind of problem arises everywhere.
p329_100,There are lots of these women in Finland.
p329_101,Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p329_102,There is no guarantee.
p329_103,We make good weapons.
p329_104,I'm confident we can turn things around.
p329_105,"He lost his job, but it was not just a job."
p329_106,The news was yesterday welcomed by union leaders.
p329_107,Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p329_108,It may be argued.
p329_109,He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p329_110,I bought a car at auction.
p329_111,They agree to meet.
p329_112,They could not hear.
p329_113,It has been hijacked.
p329_114,His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
p329_115,"He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant."
p329_116,She had been sexually assaulted.
p329_117,The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p329_118,That is different from being impartial.
p329_119,Both offices were closed yesterday.
p329_120,"They don't have to, but they normally do."
p329_121,"Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn."
p329_122,David was not either.
p329_123,They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p329_124,He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p329_125,More patience and composure was required.
p329_126,That's why the young musicians have joined.
p329_127,There is no smoking gun.
p329_128,The trial is set for February.
p329_129,I didn't play well last year.
p329_130,It was an ambush.
p329_131,Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p329_132,Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p329_133,"If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid."
p329_134,Is that too much to ask?
p329_135,I have so much respect for him.
p329_136,Each one has its own system.
p329_137,I felt under no pressure today.
p329_138,The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p329_139,And that was the adults.
p329_140,"Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim."
p329_141,That is a job for the Government.
p329_142,And he had much need.
p329_143,Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p329_144,The other children were severely mentally impaired.
p329_145,This can only help us go forward.
p329_146,That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p329_147,"But, even so, you always want to try something new."
p329_148,Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
p329_149,I hadn't been looking after myself.
p329_150,"And really, the songs are the key thing."
p329_151,His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p329_152,Perhaps they knew something we didn't.
p329_153,Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
p329_154,The whole experience has left me bitter.
p329_155,I guess it is down to focus.
p329_156,There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p329_157,I have great respect for all my players.
p329_158,His track record is not promising.
p329_159,"No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her."
p329_160,For a moment it was all about her.
p329_161,It will be a great night.
p329_162,"Sadly, the game will never see his like again."
p329_163,Trading Places was too obvious.
p329_164,"What if the confession is, after all, a fake?"
p329_165,That's the way it is.
p329_166,We've been calling for a level playing field.
p329_167,I see the extended family once a year.
p329_168,I am not a magician.
p329_169,We couldn't go very fast.
p329_170,There was even a joke.
p329_171,"Tony Blair, can you see her face?"
p329_172,You probably have never seen them before.
p329_173,They had previously been on five-day notice.
p329_174,She had experience of the wildest places.
p329_175,It is highly unlikely.
p329_176,The show is small but perfectly formed.
p329_177,That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p329_178,"It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege."
p329_179,It is too early to speculate.
p329_180,I love the moment of being first.
p329_181,Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p329_182,Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p329_183,"She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak."
p329_184,Or so we have long assumed.
p329_185,They responded with victories.
p329_186,"I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies."
p329_187,What is the truth about the cow?
p329_188,They will want to watch a winning team.
p329_189,I think it's awful.
p329_190,Who is going to be penalised?
p329_191,This will be just another tax on motorists.
p329_192,River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p329_193,It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p329_194,"The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale."
p329_195,It is a scandal.
p329_196,Nor should there have been.
p329_197,Just see where the blood is coming from.
p329_198,"Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported."
p329_199,I have a theory.
p329_200,But these were the nights.
p329_201,"In her opinion, the rich are different."
p329_202,"Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention."
p329_203,I am aware that somebody made a threat.
p329_204,He was jailed for five years.
p329_205,"Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers."
p329_206,We will not break even.
p329_207,We will look into it.
p329_208,Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p329_209,"IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does."
p329_210,What did they think of her voice?
p329_211,But he's not afraid to take risks.
p329_212,Three years probation is just a joke.
p329_213,We did not talk about it.
p329_214,"However, they continued in their pursuit of victory."
p329_215,The court has not decided.
p329_216,We are opening an inquiry.
p329_217,I get to work with very good people.
p329_218,A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p329_219,We find this very sad.
p329_220,Four people died instantly.
p329_221,"But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene."
p329_222,"And we know that, because we know the hairdresser."
p329_223,I'm really happy with the way it went.
p329_224,It is a step on the way.
p329_225,Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p329_226,I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p329_227,People tended to stay there for some time.
p329_228,All businesses continue to trade.
p329_229,It's a difficult job.
p329_230,Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p329_231,My preference is for the single vaccines.
p329_232,This represents a tough game for us.
p329_233,The boy is no longer with us.
p329_234,I can't wait for the outdoors.
p329_235,This is my new career.
p329_236,It really was a masterful innings.
p329_237,Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p329_238,I would urge the Government to think again.
p329_239,It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p329_240,They were on holiday in Egypt.
p329_241,I was happiest with my short game.
p329_242,I leave tonight for England.
p329_243,There is no change in our position.
p329_244,Everything else is a bonus.
p329_245,We went on to become very successful.
p329_246,I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p329_247,We must learn from the past.
p329_248,"We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't."
p329_249,We told them in August.
p329_250,That could be at least five years away.
p329_251,That is my role.
p329_252,I have no comment to make.
p329_253,The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
p329_254,He also presented You Bet!
p329_255,I just went a bit too far.
p329_256,And how he kept his word.
p329_257,This is a wonderful honour for me.
p329_258,"In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience."
p329_259,He was a crazy man.
p329_260,Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p329_261,That kind of growth is the important thing.
p329_262,I have no argument with Scotland.
p329_263,And a film maker was born.
p329_264,It was also put on the Internet.
p329_265,The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
p329_266,I hope he stays.
p329_267,He also has a Scottish grandfather.
p329_268,Now that was a boxing movie.
p329_269,Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p329_270,There was a battle there.
p329_271,I might also completely change the routine.
p329_272,Today's ruling confirms that fact.
p329_273,It's good news and long overdue.
p329_274,I'd never heard him in person before.
p329_275,"From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern."
p329_276,I saw them not long after it happened.
p329_277,He doesn't do dinner.
p329_278,He has been campaigning for change for years.
p329_279,That's a very strong element.
p329_280,A formal decision will be announced within months.
p329_281,I have beaten her a few times.
p329_282,He was at home with his pals.
p329_283,We are taking it seriously.
p329_284,It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p329_285,Maybe this battle has been.
p329_286,The manager is there to make these decisions.
p329_287,"Now, she has completed a family tradition."
p329_288,Then followed a bout of flu.
p329_289,I have worked with him on projects.
p329_290,We had no part in it.
p329_291,His father and mother are in film production.
p329_292,The methadone programme is completely out of control.
p329_293,It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p329_294,The referee had been right.
p329_295,Our young people are leaving.
p329_296,That would have been too easy.
p329_297,She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p329_298,This is not a faceless system.
p329_299,This is a long-term discussion paper.
p329_300,In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p329_301,That is just a load of baloney.
p329_302,I'm feeling very pleased.
p329_303,The damage from the fire was huge.
p329_304,She had kept the news from him.
p329_305,Both agreed on the success of the event.
p329_306,But we'll just keep trying to get results.
p329_307,A play is a set of actions.
p329_308,"Clearly, that is important in nursing."
p329_309,"Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives."
p329_310,The campaign was raucous.
p329_311,Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
p329_312,But both were involved with other matters.
p329_313,"We were in different places, usually in cellars."
p329_314,"However, in October another partnership was announced."
p329_315,There is no threat to them.
p329_316,The time is up for Iraq to comply.
p329_317,Nelson does not disappoint.
p329_318,The woman is basically off her head.
p329_319,The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p329_320,Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p329_321,It is high time to act.
p329_322,Then we will face the Danish champions.
p329_323,"He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display."
p329_324,The South African defended his work ethic.
p329_325,Pressure of work is no excuse.
p329_326,There was barely a handful of chances.
p329_327,That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p329_328,"But when he left, the decision was forced upon us."
p329_329,I can't believe something like this could happen.
p329_330,"Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong."
p329_331,"As often as not, the cause remains a mystery."
p329_332,"However, we have not come to any conclusions."
p329_333,"Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week."
p329_334,That is not the way we should operate.
p329_335,The new work will begin in the autumn.
p329_336,"Here, again, they were denied a voice."
p329_337,We have nothing to hide.
p329_338,It might have been a satanic ritual.
p329_339,I'll take the blame for that.
p329_340,It is now time for justice.
p329_341,That is no use.
p329_342,There is great interest on our island.
p329_343,But he is frustrated at every turn.
p329_344,Our house was very small.
p329_345,"Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius."
p329_346,Later they changed their minds.
p329_347,"Clearly, it is time to meet this young man."
p329_348,First is open defiance.
p329_349,That is absolute nonsense.
p329_350,I just had so much fun.
p329_351,It was quite rigorous.
p329_352,It is a decision which has paid off.
p329_353,He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p329_354,Their mind was already made up.
p329_355,I had some time with Aston Villa.
p329_356,We do not expect any surplus.
p329_357,You don't do the same thing with men.
p329_358,Just don't go looking to be shocked.
p329_359,Pray that it is so.
p329_360,"No, is the answer to your first question."
p329_361,There was support from across the board.
p329_362,There may be some evidence to this effect.
p329_363,"It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition."
p329_364,"We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent."
p329_365,We have been preparing all year.
p329_366,The position on the euro remains unchanged.
p329_367,So what does one do?
p329_368,Such actions are rarely popular.
p329_369,News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p329_370,Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p329_371,I joined a group.
p329_372,The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
p329_373,They probably expected something special from me.
p329_374,But we could not change his mind.
p329_375,We have a team to reach the final.
p329_376,"However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far."
p329_377,The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p329_378,I see no reason for them to be.
p329_379,"Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey."
p329_380,I never agreed with that.
p329_381,Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p329_382,He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
p329_383,"He added, however, that all options are under review."
p329_384,It is a dilemma.
p329_385,We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p329_386,They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p329_387,There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
p329_388,They did not interfere.
p329_389,Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p329_390,It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p329_391,I'm happy to contribute to that.
p329_392,"Despite the result, it was still a great moment."
p329_393,My father died in childbirth.
p329_394,As if he were a High Court judge.
p329_395,And that started me thinking.
p329_396,"Offered the gold medal, he declined."
p329_397,It brings together two essential elements.
p329_398,The issue has still to be resolved.
p329_399,He is a joy to watch.
p329_400,We have high hopes that this will work.
p329_401,We are now open.
p329_402,People ask about the concept of a team.
p329_403,Who has he fought?
p329_404,The film is about the cost of genius.
p329_405,They've been here before.
p329_406,I want a free vote.
p329_407,"He came close to signing for Rangers, too."
