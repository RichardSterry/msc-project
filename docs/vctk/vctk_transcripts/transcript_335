p335_001,Please call Stella.
p335_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p335_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p335_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p335_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p335_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p335_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p335_008,"These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p335_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p335_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p335_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p335_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p335_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p335_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p335_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p335_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p335_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p335_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p335_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p335_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p335_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p335_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p335_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p335_025,He was born in London of Scottish parents.
p335_026,Her condition last night was described as critical.

p335_044,The failings are serious.
p335_045,The prognosis is excellent.
p335_046,Rangers deserved to beat us.
p335_047,"That, though, is the measure of the man."

p335_063,I've learned from my mistakes.
p335_064,This must be wrong.
p335_065,"He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river."
p335_066,"It probably didn't feel anything, she added."
p335_067,I go home only once.
p335_068,I am delighted to hear this wonderful news.
p335_069,It is a family day out.

p335_089,We still don't know what's happened.
p335_090,His team management was protective.
p335_091,The proposal was rejected.

p335_104,"Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted."
p335_105,Which perhaps is just as well.

p335_107,They receive a high profile in the media.
p335_108,"They have got their position, we have got our position."
p335_109,There will be plenty to keep them occupied.

p335_115,But it will backfire.
p335_116,We kept going right to the final whistle.
p335_117,Police were also perplexed.
