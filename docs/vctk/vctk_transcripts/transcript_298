p298_001,Please call Stella.
p298_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p298_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p298_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p298_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p298_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p298_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p298_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p298_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p298_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p298_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p298_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p298_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p298_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p298_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p298_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p298_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p298_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p298_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p298_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p298_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p298_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p298_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p298_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p298_025,It is bad news for the flooded areas.
