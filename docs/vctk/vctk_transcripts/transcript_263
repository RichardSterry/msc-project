p263_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p263_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p263_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p263_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p263_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p263_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p263_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p263_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p263_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p263_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p263_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p263_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p263_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p263_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p263_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p263_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p263_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p263_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p263_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p263_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p263_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p263_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p263_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p263_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p263_025,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p263_026,"How are you, sir ?
"
p263_027,"So is that it, then ?
"
p263_028,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p263_029,"What do we do ?
"
p263_030,"We would like to find another region to develop in England.
"
p263_031,"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
"
p263_032,"I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
"
p263_033,"Allan Johnston was not match fit.
"
p263_034,"The idea is not new.
"
p263_035,"I could not do it.
"
p263_036,"Life was like a timetable.
"
p263_037,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p263_038,"You have to expect this type of thing.
"
p263_039,"No company would want to put their people at risk.
"
p263_040,"At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
"
p263_041,"It could well be the case.
"
p263_042,"This work on a marketing strategy would be finished within two months.
"
p263_043,"She is believed to be in South Africa.
"
p263_044,"It will come all right.
"
p263_045,"It seemed the tough times were behind him.
"
p263_046,"That company should not be allowed to operate in this country.
"
p263_047,"The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
"
p263_048,"Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
"
p263_049,"I didn't think any player was a success on Saturday.
"
p263_050,"People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
"
p263_051,"I would love to have him home.
"
p263_052,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p263_053,"He will need that machine.
"
p263_054,"Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
"
p263_055,"Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
"
p263_056,"We have not given up hope.
"
p263_057,"It will now take over the running of the estate.
"
p263_058,"I've got to provide for my family.
"
p263_059,"It was bound to happen.
"
p263_060,"Four other charges were dropped.
"
p263_061,"We have to keep our clients.
"
p263_062,"Indeed, it is only the beginning.
"
p263_063,"Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
"
p263_064,"I am pleased to be in them.
"
p263_065,"He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
"
p263_066,"But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
"
p263_067,"There is an element of racism in Scotland.
"
p263_068,"Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
"
p263_069,"It is the only way forward for the club.
"
p263_070,"I was very pleased with them today, though.
"
p263_071,"It's all I can do.
"
p263_072,"The girls are so lucky to be alive.
"
p263_073,"It was nice to get a clean sheet.
"
p263_074,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p263_075,"Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
"
p263_076,"Even the one she loved.
"
p263_077,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p263_078,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p263_079,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p263_080,"And does it ?
"
p263_081,"Are you from the rugby ?
"
p263_082,"Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
"
p263_083,"Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
"
p263_084,"The insurance company is only interested in your profits.
"
p263_085,"However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
"
p263_086,"Thomson is expected to manage the business.
"
p263_087,"The damage from the fire was huge.
"
p263_088,"A play is a set of actions.
"
p263_089,"Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
"
p263_090,"Scottish rugby has been in a state of civil war.
"
p263_091,"I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
"
p263_092,"The first few days will determine whether she can survive.
"
p263_093,"The trick is to try it.
"
p263_094,"The city council is a major property owner in the area.
"
p263_095,"It might change your life.
"
p263_096,"No-one in the passenger train was hurt.
"
p263_097,"Mr Blair should be warned.
"
p263_098,"You might not make it.
"
p263_099,"Officers recovered a second body in the area.
"
p263_100,"However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
"
p263_101,"Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
"
p263_102,"I did not have a bet on myself.
"
p263_103,"I saw the whole thing.
"
p263_104,"A progress report will be published in October.
"
p263_105,"The investment will be in the food.
"
p263_106,"There is a contract in existence for Allan.
"
p263_107,"Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
"
p263_108,"Our preference is to play in midweek.
"
p263_109,"You are like an animal.
"
p263_110,"In the end we made too many errors.
"
p263_111,"It has been a nightmare of frustration.
"
p263_112,"That all hope is never lost.
"
p263_113,"It should be a great game, though.
"
p263_114,"Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
"
p263_115,"It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
"
p263_116,"He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
"
p263_117,"He was jailed for a year.
"
p263_118,"It was won on the issue of the land.
"
p263_119,"Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
"
p263_120,"The fire was above the hole.
"
p263_121,"Pupils will be the losers.
"
p263_122,"The problem was a social problem.
"
p263_123,"Such actions are rarely popular.
"
p263_124,"Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
"
p263_125,"It isn't a happy memory.
"
p263_126,"When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
"
p263_127,"They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
"
p263_128,"They've got to account for it.
"
p263_129,"It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
"
p263_130,"It would be great to reward the Scottish public with a win.
"
p263_131,"You can spend money on housing.
"
p263_132,"I told him I was a long time ago.
"
p263_133,"They have to come clean.
"
p263_134,"It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
"
p263_135,"I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
"
p263_136,"His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
"
p263_137,"It is just a tax on employment.
"
p263_138,"The move has provoked a mixed response.
"
p263_139,"The squad is too small.
"
p263_140,"Why change it ?
"
p263_141,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p263_142,"Does the name matter ?
"
p263_143,"how do you get it back ?
"
p263_144,"The temperature in the town is very difficult to control.
"
p263_145,"Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
"
p263_146,"Any success would have been an improvement.
"
p263_147,"Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
"
p263_148,"I never wanted a legal battle.
"
p263_149,"And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
"
p263_150,"Next time round, it will be different.
"
p263_151,"She died at her home.
"
p263_152,"We have seen a copy of the report.
"
p263_153,"But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
"
p263_154,"It is the quality of the work that counts.
"
p263_155,"Check that he is dead.
"
p263_156,"Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
"
p263_157,"Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
"
p263_158,"There is no mandate for a regime change.
"
p263_159,"Like the others, he was arrested.
"
p263_160,"She will do for me.
"
p263_161,"I have had a good life.
"
p263_162,"It was deployed in the Gulf War.
"
p263_163,"The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
"
p263_164,"It is crucial for both teams.
"
p263_165,"However, she did not report the matter to the police.
"
p263_166,"Nobody in Scotland has recognised the creative talent involved in this area.
"
p263_167,"One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
"
p263_168,"The other businesses were based in Yorkshire and Northern Ireland.
"
p263_169,"I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
"
p263_170,"Neither side can win this war.
"
p263_171,"Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
"
p263_172,"These days are long gone.
"
p263_173,"It is an attitude of mind.
"
p263_174,"They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
"
p263_175,"Eight months later, he was dead.
"
p263_176,"Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
"
p263_177,"The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
"
p263_178,"Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
"
p263_179,"So was the first half.
"
p263_180,"You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
"
p263_181,"The decision was blamed on weak investment markets.
"
p263_182,"It's nice to be involved.
"
p263_183,"Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
"
p263_184,"Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
"
p263_185,"Waiting times for these services are too long.
"
p263_186,"Time is now very short.
"
p263_187,"Our position remains the same.
"
p263_188,"It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
"
p263_189,"The region is open for business.
"
p263_190,"I feel like my game has come a long way.
"
p263_191,"The championship is different from the other majors.
"
p263_192,"It makes no influence on the public.
"
p263_193,"I thought he did very well.
"
p263_194,"Says the Duke of York.
"
p263_195,"The shooting created panic in the street.
"
p263_196,"Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
"
p263_197,"It could be done by experts and lawyers.
"
p263_198,"You know the sort of thing.
"
p263_199,"My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
"
p263_200,"We are committed to realising the potential of every child.
"
p263_201,"It is a terrible loss.
"
p263_202,"I think, therefore I am ?
"
p263_203,"Who was she ?
"
p263_204,"Or was it ?
"
p263_205,"And they were being paid ?
"
p263_206,"Two years later, she was dead.
"
p263_207,"It is not easy to live in Russia.
"
p263_208,"It is difficult to comment on the prospects for the year ahead.
"
p263_209,"However, this idea is never developed.
"
p263_210,"We believe the world has too many refugees already.
"
p263_211,"We must keep our feet on the ground.
"
p263_212,"It is hard to tell.
"
p263_213,"He should emerge as the winner.
"
p263_214,"I came home by ambulance.
"
p263_215,"This decision was taken with the full support of Scottish ministers.
"
p263_216,"The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
"
p263_217,"The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
"
p263_218,"Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
"
p263_219,"On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
"
p263_220,"They are in the euro.
"
p263_221,"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
"
p263_222,"The defender should have won the bloody ba.
"
p263_223,"A deadline is still essential.
"
p263_224,"We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
"
p263_225,"Bombing is the easy option.
"
p263_226,"He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
"
p263_227,"Abbey National is an option.
"
p263_228,"We can hardly talk about it.
"
p263_229,"It was located on the remote control.
"
p263_230,"It is safe in our hands.
"
p263_231,"I'm just a regular person.
"
p263_232,"I am considered a teenager.
"
p263_233,"In each case they were a goal down.
"
p263_234,"It's just a normal life.
"
p263_235,"He remains a main board director of Royal.
"
p263_236,"People should make their own decisions.
"
p263_237,"That you can do it.
"
p263_238,"We will reform the welfare state.
"
p263_239,"It could be to do with the location.
"
p263_241,"It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
"
p263_242,"She will attend in July.
"
p263_243,"The body follows the mind.
"
p263_244,"I always felt that I was in control of the match.
"
p263_245,"We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
"
p263_246,"That will be the criteria for the future.
"
p263_247,"I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
"
p263_248,"We were a load of rubbish.
"
p263_249,"He has run a hell of a race.
"
p263_250,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p263_251,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p263_252,"Is it in the right place ?
"
p263_253,"Did he trip ?
"
p263_254,"Does that put pressure on us ?
"
p263_255,"Frankly, it was worth the booking.
"
p263_256,"The deal is expected to be completed by next summer.
"
p263_257,"The irony was not lost.
"
p263_258,"Three weeks later, he resigned.
"
p263_259,"We have a free vote on these things in our party.
"
p263_260,"It might be sad, but it's a fact.
"
p263_261,"You look like a rugby player.
"
p263_262,"Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
"
p263_263,"A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
"
p263_264,"It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
"
p263_265,"You can feel at home in China.
"
p263_266,"We've got a lot of that sort of nonsense in the North-east.
"
p263_267,"The whole point is to get the issue into the open.
"
p263_268,"My son was too young to die.
"
p263_269,"It should have taken a year for a company this size.
"
p263_270,"We were not allowed to go to help them.
"
p263_271,"I didn't see the point.
"
p263_272,"It seems a shame to leave it.
"
p263_273,"The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
"
p263_274,"I can't get a job.
"
p263_275,"I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
"
p263_276,"That could be in place by next year.
"
p263_277,"The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
"
p263_278,"The distinction is also supported by doctors.
"
p263_279,"They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
"
p263_280,"They must play for each other.
"
p263_281,"The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
"
p263_282,"It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
"
p263_283,"They can leave at any time.
"
p263_284,"I was delighted with the way he jumped.
"
p263_285,"Much of the equipment was new.
"
p263_286,"You get a lot for your money.
"
p263_287,"An announcement will follow in due course.
"
p263_288,"He has not created a Festival resource.
"
p263_289,"He was also married with two children.
"
p263_291,"I was first in the door.
"
p263_292,"Access has been a nightmare.
"
p263_293,"Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
"
p263_294,"It will always be the highlight of my career.
"
p263_295,"Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
"
p263_296,"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
"
p263_297,"She failed in her action.
"
p263_298,"Its body language is all wrong.
"
p263_299,"However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
"
p263_300,"The record companies have gone through the floor.
"
p263_301,"So the Government will be damaged.
"
p263_302,"I have lost all confidence.
"
p263_303,"John was there already in spirit.
"
p263_304,"In the end, it was no choice.
"
p263_305,"Are they free ?
"
p263_306,"What are they for ?
"
p263_307,"Is there a waiting list ?
"
p263_308,"Do they think anyone else wants them ?
"
p263_309,"I intended to look for another club on loan.
"
p263_310,"However, a ruling will not come before next week.
"
p263_311,"Motherwell have no such good fortune.
"
p263_312,"The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
"
p263_313,"I have decided to stand down from the list.
"
p263_314,"Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
"
p263_315,"They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
"
p263_316,"But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
"
p263_317,"It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
"
p263_318,"Nothing has been put into action.
"
p263_319,"Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
"
p263_320,"Like many companies, it is a problem.
"
p263_321,"Action must be taken to slow down the traffic.
"
p263_322,"However, a bid was never made.
"
p263_323,"We're not an employment agency.
"
p263_324,"I could not have hoped to run at this level.
"
p263_325,"Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
"
p263_326,"The following year was a miserable time for Mr Dewar.
"
p263_327,"At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
"
p263_328,"They come to enjoy themselves.
"
p263_329,"There's still a bit to go.
"
p263_330,"We have a good healthy debate.
"
p263_331,"Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
"
p263_332,"It is a court case.
"
p263_333,"The minister is the engineer.
"
p263_334,"There is no plan B.
"
p263_335,"He will go a long way.
"
p263_336,"The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
"
p263_337,"He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
"
p263_338,"The Premier League has been a huge success.
"
p263_339,"There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
"
p263_340,"She is on a life support machine.
"
p263_341,"He is married with three children.
"
p263_342,"Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
"
p263_343,"It's difficult to predict the future.
"
p263_344,"My body is clearly capable.
"
p263_345,"Tourists are only concerned with the quality of their experience.
"
