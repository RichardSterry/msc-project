p239_001,"Please call Stella.
"
p239_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
"
p239_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
"
p239_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
"
p239_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
"
p239_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
"
p239_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
"
p239_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
"
p239_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
"
p239_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it.
"
p239_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
"
p239_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
"
p239_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
"
p239_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
"
p239_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
"
p239_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
"
p239_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
"
p239_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
"
p239_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
"
p239_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
"
p239_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
"
p239_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
"
p239_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
"
p239_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p239_025,"They might have asked, for goodness sake.
"
p239_026,"The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
"
p239_027,"And so was a photograph.
"
p239_028,"We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.
"
p239_029,"There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
"
p239_030,"It is about control of our economy.
"
p239_031,"There was a rush of water.
"
p239_032,"That's all I was trying to do today.
"
p239_033,"Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
"
p239_034,"Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
"
p239_035,"I might well have done so already.
"
p239_036,"That can cost him a fortune.
"
p239_037,"He works at the airport.
"
p239_038,"How do you take them away ?
"
p239_039,"However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
"
p239_040,"After the match, do you ?
"
p239_041,"Has the conflict started ?
"
p239_042,"Have I really come to this ?
"
p239_043,"This matter has still to come before the European Parliament.
"
p239_044,"It carried a double message.
"
p239_045,"Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
"
p239_046,"But not a penny has been paid.
"
p239_047,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p239_048,"Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
"
p239_049,"We must learn to finish.
"
p239_050,"You must always attempt to raise the bar.
"
p239_051,"New York is my home.
"
p239_052,"The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
"
p239_053,"I remember that day well.
"
p239_054,"Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
"
p239_055,"He is too weak to move.
"
p239_056,"Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
"
p239_057,"I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
"
p239_058,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p239_059,"That's been the difference between the sides.
"
p239_060,"And they removed a Borderer.
"
p239_061,"All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
"
p239_062,"Perhaps we should do the same.
"
p239_063,"Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
"
p239_064,"They were on holiday in Egypt.
"
p239_065,"They desperately want some stability.
"
p239_066,"Everything is possible in football.
"
p239_067,"Everyone could see the joke.
"
p239_068,"I'm pleased with the horse.
"
p239_069,"He will need that machine.
"
p239_070,"The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV.
"
p239_071,"Then they scored two goals to win.
"
p239_072,"In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
"
p239_073,"Pulled a huge number of viewers.
"
p239_074,"The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
"
p239_075,"Let's not be too despondent.
"
p239_076,"The Government does not go far enough.
"
p239_077,"He phoned the number in the brochure.
"
p239_078,"I haven't got there yet.
"
p239_079,"I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
"
p239_080,"They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
"
p239_081,"In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
"
p239_082,"Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.
"
p239_083,"But the organisers refused to worry.
"
p239_084,"And it had two seats.
"
p239_085,"Indeed, it is only the beginning.
"
p239_086,"Or so the theory goes.
"
p239_087,"He has really done well.
"
p239_088,"So what happens next ?
"
p239_089,"Had this been common practice ?
"
p239_090,"What do they want us to do ?
"
p239_091,"Is it worth it ?
"
p239_092,"Does it matter ?
"
p239_093,"George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
"
p239_094,"But I had never been in a theatre.
"
p239_095,"It was fun, but not a living.
"
p239_096,"Kenny Miller might come through.
"
p239_097,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p239_098,"The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
"
p239_099,"We will pay their bills.
"
p239_100,"Sales are falling after years of growth.
"
p239_101,"It was exactly four months away.
"
p239_102,"But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.
"
p239_103,"We have a major concern about enforcement action.
"
p239_104,"I am so proud of him.
"
p239_105,"This time, it might be for real.
"
p239_106,"He will be kept informed.
"
p239_107,"There could be a way back.
"
p239_108,"He was a lovely man.
"
p239_109,"People will have to be patient.
"
p239_110,"I can't remember a lot of it.
"
p239_111,"Instead, another depression came in.
"
p239_112,"Talk of a crisis is absurd.
"
p239_113,"We have thought about doing lots of things.
"
p239_114,"It is sometimes like that.
"
p239_115,"The partners are looking for answers.
"
p239_116,"I've had it for the exams.
"
p239_117,"Those people must be accountable.
"
p239_118,"We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
"
p239_119,"The Festival is prepared to help.
"
p239_120,"Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
"
p239_121,"The error appeared in a warrant.
"
p239_122,"They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
"
p239_123,"Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
"
p239_124,"He was just a journalist.
"
p239_125,"They lived for their children.
"
p239_126,"Their season has been consigned to history.
"
p239_127,"Diversions were put in place.
"
p239_128,"How independent is that ?
"
p239_129,"What form did that take ?
"
p239_130,"Are they free ?
"
p239_131,"What are they for ?
"
p239_132,"Is there a waiting list ?
"
p239_133,"Do they think anyone else wants them ?
"
p239_134,"Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.
"
p239_135,"Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
"
p239_136,"Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
"
p239_137,"Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
"
p239_138,"The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
"
p239_139,"It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
"
p239_140,"So it was at Easter Road.
"
p239_141,"A move to Manchester United would be tremendous.
"
p239_142,"Absences should be carefully monitored.
"
p239_143,"He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
"
p239_144,"The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
"
p239_145,"We just have to adapt.
"
p239_146,"He was forced to quit.
"
p239_147,"Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
"
p239_148,"People have been placed in a state of alarm.
"
p239_149,"I was given no instructions by no-one.
"
p239_150,"The move follows a review of the Singapore
"
p239_151,"Which isn't a bad idea.
"
p239_152,"Since then, things have improved.
"
p239_153,"That's what happened against Ayr.
"
p239_154,"Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
"
p239_155,"He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
"
p239_156,"It is a good lifestyle.
"
p239_157,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p239_158,"Our relationship has been very good.
"
p239_159,"It was the climax of the thing.
"
p239_160,"Nato has left them with no other option.
"
p239_161,"Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
"
p239_162,"I think the referee was good.
"
p239_163,"I understand the medical concerns.
"
p239_164,"Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
"
p239_165,"This was a unique election.
"
p239_166,"They exist in name alone.
"
p239_167,"We have reacted well to each other.
"
p239_168,"I can see it now.
"
p239_169,"Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
"
p239_170,"There's still plenty time left.
"
p239_171,"Those three weeks are totally lost.
"
p239_172,"This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
"
p239_173,"She is in good spirits.
"
p239_174,"As if that is an achievement.
"
p239_175,"Mr Blair should be warned.
"
p239_176,"Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
"
p239_177,"There was a fossil on screen.
"
p239_178,"Is it in the right place ?
"
p239_179,"Did he trip ?
"
p239_180,"Does that put pressure on us ?
"
p239_181,"Did it work ?
"
p239_182,"Do you think we are a top nation ?
"
p239_183,"Here, again, they were denied a voice.
"
p239_184,"Structural changes were also required.
"
p239_185,"His job was not advertised.
"
p239_186,"That was just one night.
"
p239_187,"This is a frightening development.
"
p239_188,"They keep the atmosphere in mind.
"
p239_189,"Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
"
p239_190,"Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
"
p239_191,"That is an entirely unacceptable position.
"
p239_192,"My father died in childbirth.
"
p239_193,"In addition, margins have been maintained.
"
p239_194,"Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
"
p239_195,"The Yugoslav army will still be there.
"
p239_196,"Two years of building a business will go up in smoke.
"
p239_197,"You've got to be vigilant.
"
p239_198,"He said the director had been completely friendly.
"
p239_199,"Tiger is not the norm.
"
p239_200,"It's been a humbling year.
"
p239_201,"Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
"
p239_202,"Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
"
p239_203,"It is all to do with the coaching.
"
p239_204,"There was a fine line to tread.
"
p239_205,"The refund is fully justified.
"
p239_206,"My wife and family are the support system.
"
p239_207,"We are now working with full-time on future product.
"
p239_208,"He has many offers from the English Premiership.
"
p239_209,"He is a very talented player.
"
p239_210,"Bottling is now the core business.
"
p239_211,"I would be surprised if he decided to give up.
"
p239_212,"The protest will go ahead as planned.
"
p239_213,"People have been wonderful beyond belief.
"
p239_214,"The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
"
p239_215,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p239_216,"We had to add value.
"
p239_217,"Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
"
p239_218,"IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
"
p239_219,"So I got a blood test.
"
p239_220,"Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
"
p239_221,"I was caught out a little bit.
"
p239_222,"There's always the next century.
"
p239_223,"The business has expanded rapidly, however.
"
p239_224,"But it's an enjoyable job.
"
p239_225,"Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
"
p239_226,"There's only one team in Ayrshire.
"
p239_227,"Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
"
p239_228,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p239_229,"Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
"
p239_230,"She had gone to the Catholic school.
"
p239_231,"Then we will face the Danish champions.
"
p239_232,"It would seem a natural progression.
"
p239_233,"Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
"
p239_234,"We will turn the corner.
"
p239_235,"Of course, it is a tough assignment.
"
p239_236,"My Dad is a hero.
"
p239_237,"Jackie is passionate about Scotland.
"
p239_238,"Further details are expected later.
"
p239_239,"This is absolutely not true.
"
p239_240,"They should stop the bombing.
"
p239_241,"These days are long gone.
"
p239_242,"And they were being paid ?
"
p239_243,"was everything done to save people ?
"
p239_244,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p239_245,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p239_246,"Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
"
p239_247,"I've learned from my mistakes.
"
p239_248,"Adams is surely worth a chance.
"
p239_249,"This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.
"
p239_250,"I've come here for the jersey.
"
p239_251,"The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
"
p239_252,"The strong performance is expected to continue.
"
p239_253,"The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
"
p239_254,"She replied, It could be.
"
p239_255,"Allen is strong in every shape and form.
"
p239_256,"Her political persuasion is no secret.
"
p239_257,"We have a budget in March.
"
p239_258,"ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
"
p239_259,"We have expanded too quickly.
"
p239_260,"I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.
"
p239_261,"Boats and other equipment would be pooled.
"
p239_262,"Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.
"
p239_263,"Our position remains the same.
"
p239_264,"The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
"
p239_265,"They could not match it.
"
p239_266,"He is not a pathetic figure.
"
p239_267,"The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
"
p239_268,"They made such decisions in London.
"
p239_269,"This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
"
p239_270,"Harrowing is easy, after all.
"
p239_271,"Each case is treated on merit.
"
p239_272,"A winter of discontent awaits.
"
p239_273,"I thought we were fantastic.
"
p239_274,"They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
"
p239_275,"It's going to be very closely watched.
"
p239_276,"It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
"
p239_277,"They receive a high profile in the media.
"
p239_278,"Our destiny is in our own hands.
"
p239_279,"Miller was every bit as happy.
"
p239_280,"Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
"
p239_281,"Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
"
p239_282,"There is no internal damage.
"
p239_283,"We've had great things in the past.
"
p239_284,"It could be done by experts and lawyers.
"
p239_285,"It has been recorded twice.
"
p239_286,"Aberdeen had little to offer.
"
p239_287,"However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
"
p239_288,"It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
"
p239_289,"This youngster is so exciting!
"
p239_290,"It was a pre-emptive strike.
"
p239_291,"Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
"
p239_292,"They will probably come back.
"
p239_293,"This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.
"
p239_294,"I saw them last week.
"
p239_295,"Friday night was a pretty good night.
"
p239_296,"This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
"
p239_297,"You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
"
p239_298,"We may need to take some very radical measures.
"
p239_299,"Everyone can have their opinion.
"
p239_300,"The best thing for me was to join the Army.
"
p239_301,"Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract.
"
p239_302,"Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached.
"
p239_303,"The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
"
p239_304,"That should give me a chance.
"
p239_305,"They have played their part.
"
p239_306,"This will be our new beginning.
"
p239_307,"They have the cash and the fire power.
"
p239_308,"Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
"
p239_309,"The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
"
p239_310,"Racism has no place in any sport.
"
p239_311,"Celtic were the losers then.
"
p239_312,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p239_313,"Does the name matter ?
"
p239_314,"how do you get it back ?
"
p239_315,"What are you not good at ?
"
p239_316,"I think, therefore I am ?
"
p239_317,"Who was she ?
"
p239_318,"The result is utterly compelling.
"
p239_319,"The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
"
p239_320,"I have been very nervous.
"
p239_321,"Confidence among the allies began to slip.
"
p239_322,"There were also some interesting questions and answers.
"
p239_323,"I won't make an official complaint.
"
p239_324,"It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
"
p239_325,"It wasn't about her singing, though.
"
p239_326,"They are looking at a flotation.
"
p239_327,"They make a selective perception process.
"
p239_328,"Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
"
p239_329,"He was admitted to hospital.
"
p239_330,"Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
"
p239_331,"It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
"
p239_332,"January is a bad time of year.
"
p239_333,"And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
"
p239_334,"Royal Bank declined to comment.
"
p239_335,"From there, they can go anywhere.
"
p239_336,"Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
"
p239_337,"Twaddle is a case in point.
"
p239_338,"We used to live with dignity in our country.
"
p239_339,"My daughter is an adult.
"
p239_340,"It will affect their work.
"
p239_341,"Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
"
p239_342,"I am considered a teenager.
"
p239_343,"Anyway, the job will be part-time.
"
p239_344,"The FBI could become involved.
"
p239_345,"Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
"
p239_346,"I just felt that I was broken down.
"
p239_347,"And the World Cup has not even begun.
"
p239_348,"It comes from reflection or thinking.
"
p239_349,"This is the version which appeared in our paper.
"
p239_350,"Translation - we got it wrong.
"
p239_351,"It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
"
p239_352,"They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
"
p239_353,"What happened in that game ?
"
p239_354,"Are you going to win ?
"
p239_355,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p239_356,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p239_357,"So what is the campaign about ?
