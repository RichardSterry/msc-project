p314_001,Please call Stella.
p314_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p314_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p314_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p314_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p314_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p314_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p314_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p314_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p314_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p314_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p314_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p314_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p314_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p314_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p314_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p314_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p314_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p314_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p314_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p314_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p314_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p314_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p314_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p314_025,"The Scots are, however, in good company."
p314_026,He was born in London of Scottish parents.
p314_027,Her condition last night was described as critical.

p314_033,They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p314_034,"It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers."
p314_035,"Well, what do you know?"
p314_036,But she was very human.
p314_037,There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p314_038,"If true, it will be the first sign of dissent."
p314_039,His concern is only for the future.
p314_040,We have reacted well to each other.
p314_041,Pupils and staff were sent home early.

p314_043,I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p314_044,"In fact, he didn't deliver a speech at the awards."
p314_045,He will emerge as a world leader.
p314_046,That view has not altered.
p314_047,I only half believe it.

p314_055,It was developed in the Gulf War.
p314_056,"Sub Not Used, MacKay."
p314_057,It is not normal practice.

p314_060,What happens next?
p314_061,I would not want to be young again.

p314_063,I'm astonished the men were not injured.
p314_064,There are schoolboys in uniform.

p314_071,It's the most beautiful place on earth.
p314_072,"I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament."

p314_075,So far this season this approach is working.
p314_076,I have got a knife.
p314_077,"If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute."
p314_078,What did we learn?
p314_079,I go home only once.
p314_080,I'm not going to answer that right now.
p314_081,It had a gigantic effect.
p314_082,"On that basis, he would set it aside."
p314_083,"I, like many others, will consider where we go from here."

p314_105,That would be even more disastrous.
p314_106,These guys will not lie down.
p314_107,You can expect a hell of a fuss.

p314_111,Is my wife a racist?
p314_112,"It is a pity, but you can't have everything."
p314_113,This would not be my first choice.
p314_114,His wife Margaret was not in court.
p314_115,"Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted."
p314_116,Which perhaps is just as well.
p314_117,"It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area."
p314_118,He would just say it was terrible.
p314_119,"They have got their position, we have got our position."
p314_120,That's not fair to the supporters.

p314_122,But the killer remains at large.
p314_123,It is a great shame.
p314_124,There are a lot of examples.

p314_126,But then he changed his mind.
p314_127,I really hope he thinks that through.
p314_128,Police were also perplexed.
p314_129,"For sure, you won't know unless you ask him."
p314_130,It's very tragic and traumatic.
p314_131,"For me, it's a tension you can feel."
p314_132,That's a huge amount.
p314_133,The final stage is paranoia.
