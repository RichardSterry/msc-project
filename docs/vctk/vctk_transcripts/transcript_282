p282_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p282_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p282_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p282_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p282_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p282_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p282_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p282_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p282_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p282_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p282_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p282_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p282_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p282_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p282_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p282_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p282_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p282_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p282_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p282_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p282_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p282_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
"
p282_025,"But it failed.
"
p282_026,"Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
"
p282_027,"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
"
p282_028,"However, the following year the cancer returned.
"
p282_029,"Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
"
p282_030,"This is the window.
"
p282_031,"He was jailed for five years.
"
p282_032,"Help is needed.
"
p282_033,"Then, suddenly, they weren't.
"
p282_034,"It is marvellous.
"
p282_035,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p282_036,"However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
"
p282_037,"They're just different.
"
p282_038,"It was clear.
"
p282_039,"Indeed, he does.
"
p282_040,"People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
"
p282_041,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p282_042,"Dancing was her life.
"
p282_043,"The ambition this year is to improve on last.
"
p282_044,"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
"
p282_045,"They want to be entertained.
"
p282_046,"It's the only thing.
"
p282_047,"You had better believe it.
"
p282_048,"Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
"
p282_049,"On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
"
p282_050,"A neighbour said.
"
p282_051,"It is bizarre.
"
p282_052,"There is no reason at all.
"
p282_053,"In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
"
p282_054,"Every aspect of our play was first class.
"
p282_055,"Our people are ready.
"
p282_056,"Here's a clue.
"
p282_057,"I was lost.
"
p282_058,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p282_059,"My fitness was very poor.
"
p282_060,"Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
"
p282_061,"It is unique.
"
p282_062,"I expect a rapid response.
"
p282_063,"It happened so quickly.
"
p282_064,"That's the truth.
"
p282_065,"It seems to have worked.
"
p282_066,"This is the first step.
"
p282_067,"And if he hadn't become a musician?
"
p282_068,"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
"
p282_069,"I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
"
p282_070,"But I've won both ways.
"
p282_071,"Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
"
p282_072,"Robin Williams is very subdued.
"
p282_073,"They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
"
p282_074,"It could take some time.
"
p282_075,"We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
"
p282_076,"I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
"
p282_077,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p282_078,"The party is up for it.
"
p282_079,"People must remain vigilant.
"
p282_080,"Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
"
p282_081,"What has changed?
"
p282_082,"I will miss him.
"
p282_083,"He is in the queue.
"
p282_084,"I first met him last summer.
"
p282_085,"What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
"
p282_086,"Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
"
p282_087,"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
"
p282_088,"They lived for their children.
"
p282_089,"The city council is a major property owner in the area.
"
p282_090,"Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
"
p282_091,"Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
"
p282_092,"We are on the path of change.
"
p282_093,"This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
"
p282_094,"Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
"
p282_095,"Yet, it worked.
"
p282_096,"He's been hit by it.
"
p282_097,"I love the Dome.
"
p282_098,"I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
"
p282_099,"However, we have not come to any conclusions.
"
p282_100,"It is a love affair.
"
p282_101,"Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
"
p282_102,"They make a selective perception process.
"
p282_103,"Two of the team became ill.
"
p282_104,"That would be unlawful.
"
p282_105,"I don't want to use it.
"
p282_106,"Oil embargo endorsed.
"
p282_107,"It was an adventure.
"
p282_108,"Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
"
p282_109,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p282_110,"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
"
p282_111,"I was fighting for my life, I thought.
"
p282_112,"Is that right?
"
p282_113,"He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
"
p282_114,"It's a shame.
"
p282_115,"It was the eighties.
"
p282_116,"It is so sad.
"
p282_117,"Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
"
p282_118,"The mood is upbeat.
"
p282_119,"It is rubbish.
"
p282_120,"Who would be a referee?
"
p282_121,"That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
"
p282_122,"We enjoyed it today.
"
p282_123,"His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
"
p282_124,"Here, again, they were denied a voice.
"
p282_125,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p282_126,"I'm so angry.
"
p282_127,"She really suffered for her art.
"
p282_128,"It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
"
p282_129,"It is not a U-turn.
"
p282_130,"No production was achieved.
"
p282_131,"I am now unemployed.
"
p282_132,"We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
"
p282_133,"It plans to return to this field.
"
p282_134,"We work well together.
"
p282_135,"The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
"
p282_136,"We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
"
p282_137,"Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
"
p282_138,"I was dead.
"
p282_139,"I don't know the full story.
"
p282_140,"Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
"
p282_141,"She died at her home.
"
p282_142,"He realises his mistake.
"
p282_143,"He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
"
p282_144,"Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
"
p282_145,"I was awful.
"
p282_146,"Who would have?
"
p282_147,"He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
"
p282_148,"It is not just about pay.
"
p282_149,"It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
"
p282_150,"There was a substantial explosion.
"
p282_151,"I was stunned.
"
p282_152,"The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
"
p282_153,"The weather forecast isn't good.
"
p282_154,"They have not been named.
"
p282_155,"She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
"
p282_156,"My Dad is a hero.
"
p282_157,"For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
"
p282_158,"Words were not required.
"
p282_159,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p282_160,"Life becomes a song.
"
p282_161,"Well, he should know.
"
p282_162,"Was this element always there?
"
p282_163,"These days are long gone.
"
p282_164,"I'd love to be like Peter.
"
p282_165,"I've put my own money into this project.
"
p282_166,"It has to be now.
"
p282_167,"Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
"
p282_168,"I was in the train station overnight.
"
p282_169,"We have a budget in March.
"
p282_170,"We should do everything at a stroke.
"
p282_171,"You had to go and see him.
"
p282_172,"It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
"
p282_173,"In a way he was.
"
p282_174,"They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
"
p282_175,"Blair's response was weak.
"
p282_176,"As we worked.
"
p282_177,"We are the gateway to justice.
"
p282_178,"I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
"
p282_179,"The goals were good.
"
p282_180,"Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
"
p282_181,"It's an idea.
"
p282_182,"It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
"
p282_183,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p282_184,"I saw military vehicles in the distance.
"
p282_185,"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
"
p282_186,"Does this matter?
"
p282_187,"Our team is just so young.
"
p282_188,"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
"
p282_189,"However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
"
p282_190,"It caused a lot of upset.
"
p282_191,"But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
"
p282_192,"We speak about the performance.
"
p282_193,"It is a farce.
"
p282_194,"Peace was won.
"
p282_195,"It's a fact.
"
p282_196,"I came home by ambulance.
"
p282_197,"It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
"
p282_198,"Is that success?
"
p282_199,"I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
"
p282_200,"Who will pay for this?
"
p282_201,"It's all about money, money, money.
"
p282_202,"Sadly, it can't.
"
p282_203,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p282_204,"After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
"
p282_205,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p282_206,"Feel the heat?
"
p282_207,"The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
"
p282_208,"Twaddle is a case in point.
"
p282_209,"It had all been arranged.
"
p282_210,"IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
"
p282_211,"Work has started.
"
p282_212,"The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
"
p282_213,"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
"
p282_214,"The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
"
p282_215,"Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
"
p282_216,"This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
"
p282_217,"Then another one came.
"
p282_218,"The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
"
p282_219,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p282_220,"Clearly, the stakes are high.
"
p282_221,"It's a question of creating a future awareness.
"
p282_222,"I'd never seen a play about me.
"
p282_223,"It's not before time.
"
p282_224,"I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
"
p282_225,"I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
"
p282_226,"I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
"
p282_227,"Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
"
p282_228,"My wife and family are the support system.
"
p282_229,"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
"
p282_230,"Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
"
p282_231,"We are so proud.
"
p282_232,"The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
"
p282_233,"Of course I was tempted.
"
p282_234,"It's quite a line-up!
"
p282_235,"On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
"
p282_236,"The minister is the engineer.
"
p282_237,"I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
"
p282_238,"It is hard won.
"
p282_239,"Our policy is clear.
"
p282_240,"I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
"
p282_241,"The scene is about this?
"
p282_242,"In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
"
p282_243,"My son was too young to die.
"
p282_244,"In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
"
p282_245,"Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
"
p282_246,"It was a hit.
"
p282_247,"Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
"
p282_248,"That could be in place by next year.
"
p282_249,"For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
"
p282_250,"It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
"
p282_251,"That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
"
p282_252,"they fail to engage.
"
p282_253,"It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
"
p282_254,"One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
"
p282_255,"They must play for each other.
"
p282_256,"However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
"
p282_257,"There's not much money in cycling.
"
p282_258,"This court has made an order which has not been observed.
"
p282_259,"George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
"
p282_260,"That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
"
p282_261,"He has not created a Festival resource.
"
p282_262,"He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
"
p282_263,"He was also married with two children.
"
p282_264,"It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
"
p282_265,"Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
"
p282_266,"Our objective is to tackle poverty.
"
p282_267,"One knows the feeling.
"
p282_268,"Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
"
p282_269,"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
"
p282_270,"She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
"
p282_271,"She failed in her action.
"
p282_272,"He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
"
p282_273,"She looked so young.
"
p282_274,"In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
"
p282_275,"It's so awful.
"
p282_276,"Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
"
p282_277,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p282_278,"You've got to have both sides.
"
p282_279,"Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
"
p282_280,"Dialogue is the key.
"
p282_281,"They have shown a great desire and attitude.
"
p282_282,"She is an expert on medical ethics.
"
p282_283,"Who will perform?
"
p282_284,"This is a national crisis.
"
p282_285,"Who did the recruiting?
"
p282_286,"She is really magic.
"
p282_287,"That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
"
p282_288,"I was the sheep.
"
p282_289,"I was brought up in a mining background.
"
p282_290,"In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
"
p282_291,"Nothing is safe.
"
p282_292,"But it's a subtle process.
"
p282_293,"One was a lawyer.
"
p282_294,"The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
"
p282_295,"A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
"
p282_296,"They are wrong.
"
p282_297,"Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
"
p282_298,"There were no passengers on board.
"
p282_299,"It could work.
"
p282_300,"This is a war over our home.
"
p282_301,"Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
"
p282_302,"There's no evidence he was ever there.
"
p282_303,"You should be.
"
p282_304,"However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
"
p282_305,"The letters are going out today.
"
p282_306,"Is there on his hands?
"
p282_307,"The Premier League has been a huge success.
"
p282_308,"Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
"
p282_309,"She is very distinctive.
"
p282_310,"We have got to get the points from this one.
"
p282_311,"You may have a short memory.
"
p282_312,"Henman has been warned.
"
p282_313,"We are in the end game.
"
p282_314,"It will work.
"
p282_315,"I came into this world with nothing.
"
p282_316,"They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
"
p282_317,"Our message was inclusive.
"
p282_318,"But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
"
p282_319,"Feel the air, the space.
"
p282_320,"Is there a new way forward?
"
p282_321,"We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
"
p282_322,"The figures are bad, but not that bad.
"
p282_323,"Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
"
p282_324,"However, they will only be found in the wild.
"
p282_325,"The same things will happen with GM foods.
"
p282_326,"Three years ago he would have been.
"
p282_327,"That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
"
p282_328,"Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
"
p282_329,"Two people were interviewed.
"
p282_330,"I've got no secret.
"
p282_331,"We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
"
p282_332,"This is a friendly match?
"
p282_333,"A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
"
p282_334,"This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
"
p282_335,"They should take their mobile phones.
"
p282_336,"He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
"
p282_337,"A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
"
p282_338,"Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
"
p282_339,"She is free.
"
p282_340,"Both of those promises have already been honoured.
"
p282_341,"Tyson is overwhelmed.
"
p282_342,"In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
"
p282_343,"Yet he left a few days later.
"
p282_344,"It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
"
p282_345,"As, indeed, they would be.
"
p282_346,"It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
"
p282_347,"Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
"
p282_348,"To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
"
p282_349,"The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
"
