p255_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p255_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p255_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p255_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p255_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p255_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p255_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p255_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p255_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p255_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p255_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p255_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p255_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p255_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p255_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p255_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p255_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p255_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p255_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p255_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p255_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p255_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p255_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p255_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p255_025,"He has not been named.
"
p255_026,"We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
"
p255_027,"They should be so lucky.
"
p255_028,"We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
"
p255_029,"They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
"
p255_030,"Life was like a timetable.
"
p255_031,"Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
"
p255_032,"Then, suddenly, they weren't.
"
p255_033,"It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
"
p255_034,"In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
"
p255_035,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p255_036,"We do not expect any surplus.
"
p255_037,"Dancing was her life.
"
p255_038,"It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
"
p255_039,"It is a memorial.
"
p255_040,"Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
"
p255_041,"But it might have done.
"
p255_042,"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
"
p255_043,"People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
"
p255_044,"I felt really good until Friday.
"
p255_045,"She looked so young.
"
p255_046,"Life is good.
"
p255_047,"No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
"
p255_048,"I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
"
p255_049,"We were surprised to see the photograph.
"
p255_050,"It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
"
p255_051,"Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
"
p255_052,"It's very odd.
"
p255_053,"Because we do not need it.
"
p255_054,"That's the truth.
"
p255_055,"My mother is a widow.
"
p255_057,"George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
"
p255_058,"There will be tough opponents to this report.
"
p255_059,"Equity declined to comment.
"
p255_060,"Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
"
p255_061,"Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
"
p255_062,"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
"
p255_063,"We should have known.
"
p255_064,"We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
"
p255_065,"The end result is precisely the same.
"
p255_066,"It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
"
p255_067,"There is an element of racism in Scotland.
"
p255_068,"There could be a way back.
"
p255_069,"He highlighted a lack of staff.
"
p255_070,"Then followed a bout of flu.
"
p255_071,"Ferguson should take note.
"
p255_072,"It works for us.
"
p255_073,"He is now resident in England.
"
p255_074,"I've got the shirt.
"
p255_075,"Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
"
p255_076,"What has changed?
"
p255_077,"However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
"
p255_078,"Last week, he was taken into hospital.
"
p255_079,"He is driven.
"
p255_080,"Nothing is yet confirmed.
"
p255_081,"We have other options.
"
p255_082,"We want to know about the policy.
"
p255_083,"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
"
p255_084,"It's never too late.
"
p255_085,"Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
"
p255_086,"We do not get that impression now.
"
p255_087,"It is a lifeline.
"
p255_088,"However, it did not end that way.
"
p255_089,"They've got to account for it.
"
p255_090,"That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
"
p255_091,"Until you hit the big games.
"
p255_092,"We could not get any possession.
"
p255_093,"If you could find it.
"
p255_094,"The selection process is still at a very early stage.
"
p255_095,"It is a delight on every level.
"
p255_096,"Get to know him.
"
p255_097,"May not have been at fault?
"
p255_098,"I had a ball today.
"
p255_099,"Two of the team became ill.
"
p255_100,"That time is not now, however.
"
p255_101,"Oil embargo endorsed.
"
p255_102,"Scotland were beaten again.
"
p255_103,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p255_104,"Further protests are likely.
"
p255_105,"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
"
p255_106,"It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
"
p255_107,"He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
"
p255_108,"He was jailed for a year.
"
p255_109,"I came to complete.
"
p255_110,"Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
"
p255_111,"We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
"
p255_112,"Maybe this battle has been.
"
p255_113,"I'm delighted about that.
"
p255_114,"Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
"
p255_115,"I joined a group.
"
p255_116,"Does this mean.
"
p255_117,"They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
"
p255_118,"That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
"
p255_119,"Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
"
p255_120,"An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
"
p255_121,"I can't even get into the A team.
"
p255_122,"Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
"
p255_123,"Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
"
p255_124,"His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
"
p255_125,"Next season for every manager is a long time away.
"
p255_126,"We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
"
p255_127,"It will be too hot.
"
p255_128,"The role was perfect for Russell.
"
p255_129,"If not, a deal could take many months.
"
p255_130,"My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
"
p255_131,"Our intentions are real.
"
p255_132,"It is also well received.
"
p255_133,"The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
"
p255_134,"We never said that we would walk through the third division.
"
p255_135,"Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
"
p255_136,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p255_137,"I saw some terrible things.
"
p255_138,"It's a question of fashion.
"
p255_139,"Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
"
p255_140,"In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
"
p255_141,"We have got to get it right.
"
p255_142,"Wallace was a prisoner of war.
"
p255_143,"The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
"
p255_144,"Who would be right?
"
p255_145,"She died at her home.
"
p255_146,"Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
"
p255_147,"I was awful.
"
p255_148,"The idea is simple.
"
p255_149,"It is like a football team.
"
p255_150,"It would be a last resort.
"
p255_151,"He sets the nature of his Parliament in simple, realistic context.
"
p255_152,"It is not just about pay.
"
p255_153,"The home side didn't stand a chance.
"
p255_154,"We shall not be moved.
"
p255_155,"The weaknesses are few.
"
p255_156,"The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
"
p255_157,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p255_158,"The first victory made a huge difference to my career.
"
p255_159,"There's a sense of excess in the novel.
"
p255_160,"Work has started.
"
p255_161,"It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
"
p255_162,"And sooner than we may think.
"
p255_163,"The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
"
p255_164,"It is so unfair.
"
p255_165,"I will tell you.
"
p255_166,"Eight months later, he was dead.
"
p255_167,"It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
"
p255_168,"We have to move forward.
"
p255_169,"However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
"
p255_170,"I lost my head.
"
p255_171,"That must be left to the Parole Board.
"
p255_172,"He is keen to stay in public service.
"
p255_173,"You are not going in blind.
"
p255_174,"They will do their own thing.
"
p255_175,"As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
"
p255_176,"You had to go and see him.
"
p255_177,"Waiting times for these services are too long.
"
p255_178,"A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
"
p255_179,"His team management was protective.
"
p255_180,"Is Saddam a threat?
"
p255_181,"The jury is still out.
"
p255_182,"We wanted it left for a wee while.
"
p255_183,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p255_184,"And I saw the light!
"
p255_185,"The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
"
p255_186,"I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
"
p255_187,"Tony had arrived.
"
p255_188,"It is the whole package.
"
p255_189,"I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
"
p255_190,"The goals were good.
"
p255_191,"There is no point in looking any further.
"
p255_192,"And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
"
p255_193,"Four policemen were wounded.
"
p255_194,"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
"
p255_195,"The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
"
p255_196,"They are now divorced.
"
p255_197,"I cannot say too much about them.
"
p255_198,"It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
"
p255_199,"However, this idea is never developed.
"
p255_200,"It is a farce.
"
p255_201,"I am totally surprised.
"
p255_202,"We must keep our feet on the ground.
"
p255_203,"However, he said the money had not been wasted.
"
p255_204,"The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
"
p255_205,"He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
"
p255_206,"The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
"
p255_207,"The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
"
p255_208,"It's just awful.
"
p255_209,"It's all about money, money, money.
"
p255_210,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p255_211,"We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
"
p255_212,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p255_213,"We'll have to work hard today.
"
p255_214,"He knows a lot.
"
p255_215,"That is an important part of our role.
"
p255_216,"Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
"
p255_217,"I had relied on him.
"
p255_218,"I had decided to quit the show.
"
p255_219,"His third goal was superb.
"
p255_220,"It's been a good year.
"
p255_221,"So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
"
p255_222,"It's not ideal.
"
p255_223,"The FBI could become involved.
"
p255_224,"A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
"
p255_225,"The attacker has been put in foster care.
"
p255_226,"His death was a tragic accident.
"
p255_227,"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
"
p255_228,"But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
"
p255_229,"A career as a doctor is on hold.
"
p255_230,"During the communist time they were very privileged.
"
p255_231,"Mental health is a massive issue.
"
p255_232,"We played them off the pitch.
"
p255_233,"Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
"
p255_234,"Our numbers are small.
"
p255_235,"They are the innocent victims.
"
p255_236,"It's like a basketball.
"
p255_237,"You should always be able to get out in some direction.
"
p255_238,"At the time, he was a living legend.
"
p255_239,"It's the same as Glasgow.
"
p255_240,"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
"
p255_241,"It is mainstream.
"
p255_242,"Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
"
p255_243,"We were awful.
"
p255_244,"They had no children.
"
p255_245,"It is set in Paris.
"
p255_246,"It is not the message alone.
"
p255_247,"It's quite a line-up!
"
p255_248,"It has been declared.
"
p255_249,"The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
"
p255_250,"We have a free vote on these things in our party.
"
p255_251,"It would appear that it has not been a problem.
"
p255_252,"It's only fair.
"
p255_253,"He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
"
p255_254,"Chambers said he would accept the place.
"
p255_255,"His body was never found.
"
p255_256,"There's the mix.
"
p255_257,"We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
"
p255_258,"I can't get a job.
"
p255_259,"He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
"
p255_260,"For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
"
p255_261,"That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
"
p255_262,"However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
"
p255_263,"It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
"
p255_264,"I am very angry.
"
p255_265,"They must play for each other.
"
p255_266,"He can do everything.
"
p255_267,"An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
"
p255_268,"This court has made an order which has not been observed.
"
p255_269,"The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
"
p255_270,"He thought he had a month to cross the street.
"
p255_271,"It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
"
p255_272,"They want to shut the Scottish Office.
"
p255_273,"This is a question of Islam.
"
p255_274,"It looks as though he will be right.
"
p255_275,"He was popular.
"
p255_276,"I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
"
p255_277,"Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
"
p255_278,"It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
"
p255_279,"Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
"
p255_280,"One knows the feeling.
"
p255_281,"He promised to lead from the front in battle for entry.
"
p255_282,"In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
"
p255_283,"Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
"
p255_284,"For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
"
p255_285,"This is a national crisis.
"
p255_286,"The death toll included five children.
"
p255_287,"My body is clearly capable.
"
p255_288,"So I did.
"
p255_289,"The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
"
p255_290,"She said she could not believe that they had run away.
"
p255_292,"These figures are truly awful.
"
p255_293,"It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
"
p255_294,"Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
"
p255_295,"Who can predict?
"
p255_296,"If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
"
p255_297,"A new school will be built.
"
p255_298,"I have tonight resigned as member of the European Commission.
"
p255_299,"Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
"
p255_300,"Graeme was prepared.
"
p255_301,"In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
"
p255_302,"He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
"
p255_303,"Our task is to complete the picture.
"
p255_304,"they fail to engage.
"
p255_305,"Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
"
p255_306,"The company yesterday refused to comment.
"
p255_307,"The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
"
p255_308,"It's certainly different.
"
p255_309,"Is there on his hands?
"
p255_310,"We have got no money to go anywhere.
"
p255_311,"It's about my time as a guitarist.
"
p255_312,"There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
"
p255_313,"I never thought it would take this long.
"
p255_314,"In fact, they have the opposite effect.
"
p255_315,"The election is total confusion and chaos.
"
p255_316,"Henman has been warned.
"
p255_317,"It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
"
p255_318,"I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
"
p255_319,"For the moment, our position remains the same.
"
p255_320,"Referees are easy targets.
"
p255_321,"There was some merit in that.
"
p255_322,"I came into this world with nothing.
"
p255_323,"That's the law of the land.
"
p255_324,"They will be destroyed.
"
p255_325,"It is a strong case.
"
p255_326,"My view has now completely changed.
"
p255_327,"The police have to act to help them.
"
p255_328,"We agreed to disagree.
"
p255_329,"On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
"
p255_330,"It could have gone either way.
"
p255_331,"It is a time bomb.
"
p255_332,"I'd like to take the plunge.
"
p255_333,"It can be halted.
"
p255_334,"Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
"
p255_335,"They haven't got a hope.
"
p255_336,"Gaelic provision continued to be good.
"
p255_337,"That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
"
p255_338,"The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
"
p255_339,"Today, we begin to answer that question.
"
p255_340,"Look at the witnesses.
"
p255_341,"Nobody else was with me.
"
p255_342,"A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
"
p255_343,"That is the very reason why it was so vital.
"
p255_344,"In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
"
p255_345,"This is a friendly match?
"
p255_346,"I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
"
p255_347,"Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
"
p255_348,"On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
"
