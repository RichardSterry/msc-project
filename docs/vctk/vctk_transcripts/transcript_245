p245_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p245_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p245_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p245_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p245_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p245_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p245_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p245_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p245_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p245_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p245_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p245_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p245_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p245_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p245_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p245_016,"Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p245_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p245_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p245_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p245_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p245_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p245_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p245_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p245_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p245_025,"Johnson was pretty low.
"
p245_026,"But it failed.
"
p245_027,"It's nice to hear.
"
p245_028,"We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
"
p245_029,"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
"
p245_030,"They should be so lucky.
"
p245_031,"Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
"
p245_032,"They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
"
p245_033,"I was an athlete.
"
p245_034,"They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
"
p245_035,"So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
"
p245_036,"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
"
p245_037,"However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
"
p245_038,"It has failed.
"
p245_039,"It was clear.
"
p245_040,"It's a great thing.
"
p245_041,"Indeed, he does.
"
p245_042,"People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
"
p245_043,"She is believed to be in South Africa.
"
p245_044,"But it took a lot of bottle.
"
p245_045,"Sure, it's funny.
"
p245_046,"Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
"
p245_047,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p245_048,"We need to chat.
"
p245_049,"The boy is no longer with us.
"
p245_050,"Who can say?
"
p245_051,"It's a blessing.
"
p245_053,"Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
"
p245_054,"They had to explain it.
"
p245_055,"He had no enemies.
"
p245_056,"Sadly, it can't.
"
p245_057,"None has ever been found.
"
p245_058,"It's a matter of balance.
"
p245_059,"There will be tough opponents to this report.
"
p245_060,"Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
"
p245_061,"Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
"
p245_062,"He should have asked for a second opinion.
"
p245_063,"He was popular.
"
p245_064,"Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
"
p245_065,"The script was funny.
"
p245_066,"You need a trademark.
"
p245_067,"There is an element of racism in Scotland.
"
p245_068,"The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
"
p245_069,"She died in hospital two hours later.
"
p245_070,"Is there a new way forward?
"
p245_071,"There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
"
p245_072,"People must remain vigilant.
"
p245_073,"This is the way things should be handled.
"
p245_074,"Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
"
p245_075,"What has changed?
"
p245_076,"I'd like to continue that record.
"
p245_077,"That is bound to happen.
"
p245_078,"He seems to be pleased with the picture.
"
p245_079,"We have other options.
"
p245_080,"The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
"
p245_081,"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
"
p245_082,"It's never too late.
"
p245_083,"Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
"
p245_084,"Now the system is right behind us.
"
p245_085,"Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
"
p245_086,"It is a lifeline.
"
p245_087,"The reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
"
p245_088,"Then came the crunch.
"
p245_089,"If you could find it.
"
p245_090,"Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
"
p245_091,"They were outside the circle.
"
p245_092,"He's a star.
"
p245_093,"It was some time before she found out he was safe.
"
p245_094,"We want to get to the final, anyway.
"
p245_095,"Oil embargo endorsed.
"
p245_096,"No date has been set for the appeal.
"
p245_097,"It was an adventure.
"
p245_098,"Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
"
p245_099,"They had to be cut from the wreckage.
"
p245_100,"I was angry.
"
p245_101,"That team is due to be announced this morning.
"
p245_102,"I have had no social life at all.
"
p245_103,"Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
"
p245_104,"I'm delighted about that.
"
p245_105,"We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
"
p245_106,"Who would be a referee?
"
p245_107,"There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
"
p245_108,"Who would have?
"
p245_109,"The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
"
p245_110,"We work on the same level.
"
p245_111,"I can't even get into the A team.
"
p245_112,"Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
"
p245_113,"Next season for every manager is a long time away.
"
p245_114,"They keep the atmosphere in mind.
"
p245_115,"Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
"
p245_116,"I do not think this family will ever get over this.
"
p245_117,"Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
"
p245_118,"He has been under great pressure.
"
p245_119,"Who will attend?
"
p245_120,"However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
"
p245_121,"The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
"
p245_122,"What will happen then?
"
p245_123,"Is that it?
"
p245_124,"He was in a great deal of pain.
"
p245_125,"We want to keep the pound.
"
p245_126,"Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
"
p245_127,"There is a lack of chemistry.
"
p245_128,"I was awful.
"
p245_129,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p245_130,"It is not just about pay.
"
p245_131,"He will emerge as a world leader.
"
p245_132,"They did very well.
"
p245_133,"It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
"
p245_134,"The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
"
p245_135,"The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
"
p245_136,"It was deployed in the Gulf War.
"
p245_137,"Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
"
p245_138,"Mr Blair had done well.
"
p245_139,"It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
"
p245_140,"The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
"
p245_141,"He can do no wrong.
"
p245_142,"Was this element always there?
"
p245_143,"I've learned from my mistakes.
"
p245_144,"A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
"
p245_145,"It has to be now.
"
p245_146,"I was in the train station overnight.
"
p245_147,"The release attracted little attention.
"
p245_148,"That will do for me.
"
p245_149,"Nobody did in those days.
"
p245_150,"It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
"
p245_151,"They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
"
p245_152,"It became a book by itself.
"
p245_154,"We wanted it left for a wee while.
"
p245_155,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p245_156,"The hotel was now for sale.
"
p245_157,"I drove the ball well.
"
p245_158,"Everyone can be bought.
"
p245_160,"We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
"
p245_161,"I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
"
p245_162,"They will run a mile.
"
p245_163,"We did everything by the book.
"
p245_164,"It is not fair.
"
p245_165,"What has caused the demise of singing?
"
p245_166,"I had a train to catch.
"
p245_167,"It was an odd affair, in many respects.
"
p245_168,"It is tough, but possible.
"
p245_170,"The procedure is the same in all cases.
"
p245_171,"People will ask about us.
"
p245_172,"I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
"
p245_173,"We must keep our feet on the ground.
"
p245_174,"However, he said the money had not been wasted.
"
p245_175,"Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
"
p245_176,"Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
"
p245_177,"It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
"
p245_178,"It was still there, but right at the end.
"
p245_179,"The conference is the first test.
"
p245_180,"Is that success?
"
p245_181,"But we are not immune to the problem.
"
p245_182,"The red card was okay.
"
p245_183,"I have a cold.
"
p245_184,"They are in the euro.
"
p245_185,"He's not perfect.
"
p245_186,"The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
"
p245_187,"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
"
p245_188,"It's all about money, money, money.
"
p245_189,"That will be vital.
"
p245_190,"Now, it's all right.
"
p245_191,"It's like a garage.
"
p245_192,"We don't even know his name.
"
p245_193,"Feel the heat?
"
p245_194,"He knows a lot.
"
p245_195,"I began to pray.
"
p245_196,"I had decided to quit the show.
"
p245_197,"His third goal was superb.
"
p245_198,"It's been a good year.
"
p245_199,"The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
"
p245_200,"So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
"
p245_201,"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
"
p245_202,"He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
"
p245_203,"The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
"
p245_204,"Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
"
p245_205,"The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
"
p245_206,"But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
"
p245_207,"Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
"
p245_208,"He demanded to speak to the boss.
"
p245_209,"You have to do your research.
"
p245_210,"Saturday is gone.
"
p245_211,"The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
"
p245_212,"Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
"
p245_213,"It was good fun.
"
p245_214,"At the time, he was a living legend.
"
p245_215,"It's so special.
"
p245_216,"You should always be able to get out in some direction.
"
p245_217,"I can't wait to meet him.
"
p245_218,"My wife and family are the support system.
"
p245_219,"The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
"
p245_220,"They had no children.
"
p245_221,"We are in the hat.
"
p245_222,"We were a load of rubbish.
"
p245_223,"They should come forward.
"
p245_224,"It is not the message alone.
"
p245_225,"Half of young people had had contact with the police.
"
p245_226,"It's quite a line-up!
"
p245_227,"I might get an injury very easily.
"
p245_228,"This fact is supported by audience research.
"
p245_229,"He was good, but not that good.
"
p245_230,"The problem in Norway is outside the National.
"
p245_231,"He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
"
p245_232,"Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
"
p245_233,"It would appear that it has not been a problem.
"
p245_234,"It's only fair.
"
p245_235,"He says that he is no different from any other man.
"
p245_236,"You can feel at home in China.
"
p245_237,"We did not compete with any other local farmer.
"
p245_238,"It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
"
p245_239,"There wasn't a goal.
"
p245_240,"I was shocked.
"
p245_241,"They are different types.
"
p245_242,"It was a hit.
"
p245_243,"I didn't need to watch it on the video.
"
p245_244,"There will be widespread support on all sides.
"
p245_245,"This year I understood.
"
p245_246,"Her presence was almost everywhere.
"
p245_247,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p245_248,"Is there on his hands?
"
p245_249,"I can't get a job.
"
p245_250,"It is nearly there.
"
p245_251,"He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
"
p245_252,"For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
"
p245_253,"It's that kind of place.
"
p245_254,"they fail to engage.
"
p245_256,"I was happily surprised.
"
p245_257,"However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
"
p245_258,"I would have the hammer in the crowd.
"
p245_259,"I HAVE a dream.
"
p245_260,"It is set in Paris.
"
p245_261,"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
"
p245_262,"Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
"
p245_263,"Immediate action must be taken.
"
p245_264,"It left me with a sadness.
"
p245_265,"Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
"
p245_266,"We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
"
p245_267,"Our objective is to tackle poverty.
"
p245_268,"Of course I was tempted.
"
p245_269,"However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
"
p245_270,"People have no choice.
"
p245_271,"She looked so young.
"
p245_272,"It happens from time to time.
"
p245_273,"Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
"
p245_274,"This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
"
p245_275,"You've got to have both sides.
"
p245_276,"Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
"
p245_277,"It was a virus.
"
p245_278,"Yet, it worked.
"
p245_279,"It's very safe.
"
p245_280,"Well, he can do it.
"
p245_281,"He was obviously very genuine.
"
p245_282,"It goes back a long way.
"
p245_283,"The weather forecast isn't good.
"
p245_284,"It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
"
p245_285,"He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
"
p245_286,"But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
"
p245_287,"That could change.
"
p245_288,"The goals will come.
"
p245_289,"Sunday's game was not a trial.
"
p245_290,"This is a huge confidence boost.
"
p245_291,"We have to sort it out ourselves.
"
p245_292,"He has retired.
"
p245_293,"There was no hint of scandal.
"
p245_294,"I thought it was my only chance.
"
p245_295,"Nothing is safe.
"
p245_296,"They are wrong.
"
p245_297,"The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
"
p245_298,"The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
"
p245_299,"We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
"
p245_300,"It's just not funny!
"
p245_301,"Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
"
p245_302,"And he goes with it.
"
p245_303,"You are the glory.
"
p245_304,"A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
"
p245_305,"We want to play at the worlds.
"
p245_306,"We have waited a long time for this.
"
p245_307,"He was solid.
"
p245_308,"This is the culture change in medicine.
"
p245_309,"and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
"
p245_310,"It also provides a wealth of contrast within the movement.
"
p245_311,"I never thought it would take this long.
"
p245_312,"They wanted the club to make money.
"
p245_313,"Craig is a major concern for us.
"
p245_314,"For the moment, our position remains the same.
"
p245_315,"They had a confession.
"
p245_316,"I am very happy to be here.
"
p245_317,"We think all other measures are not exhausted.
"
p245_318,"There was no time scale.
"
p245_319,"My view has now completely changed.
"
p245_320,"Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
"
p245_321,"It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
"
p245_322,"The boat was fantastic.
"
p245_323,"I saw some good things.
"
p245_324,"Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
"
p245_325,"You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
"
p245_326,"In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
"
p245_327,"Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
"
p245_328,"The same things will happen with GM foods.
"
p245_329,"Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
"
p245_330,"Who will do it?
"
p245_331,"I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
"
p245_332,"That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
"
p245_333,"I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
"
p245_334,"I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
"
p245_335,"The train was on time.
"
p245_336,"Action is needed now.
"
p245_337,"But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
"
p245_338,"Indeed, it was magical.
"
p245_339,"I would miss him.
"
p245_340,"There's no place to hide.
"
p245_341,"Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
"
p245_342,"I'm very lucky.
"
p245_343,"It was forced to divert.
"
p245_344,"Chambers said he would accept the place.
"
p245_345,"He was then replaced by Ross.
"
p245_346,"A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
"
p245_347,"Like his acting, it was an accident.
"
p245_348,"They should take their mobile phones.
"
p245_349,"It is not like working for a living.
"
p245_350,"Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
"
p245_351,"A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
"
p245_352,"The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
"
p245_353,"The decision is an absolute disgrace.
"
p245_354,"It was very formal.
"
p245_355,"The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
"
p245_356,"It's not that clear-cut.
"
