p318_001,Please call Stella.
p318_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p318_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we can go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p318_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p318_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p318_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p318_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p318_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p318_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p318_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p318_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p318_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p318_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p318_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p318_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p318_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p318_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p318_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p318_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p318_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p318_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p318_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p318_025,They will be dealt with.
p318_026,It is never an easy game.
p318_027,This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p318_028,I intend to raise the matter there.
p318_029,"However, it's good to turn the page."
p318_030,We have to put this behind us.
p318_031,I thought it was quite good.
p318_032,It was important to win the singles.
p318_033,This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p318_034,That is impressive by any standards.
p318_035,We are doing very well as we are.
p318_036,"The waiting is over, well almost."
p318_037,"This was the performance, and the result they needed."
p318_038,"I'm not allowed to say that, of course."
p318_039,It helped to get me noticed.
p318_040,They hit me in the head.
p318_041,But he is not using them.
p318_042,"That, though, was just the start of it."
p318_043,We are not moving in.
p318_044,We have not had a formal request.
p318_045,I never had a childhood.
p318_046,Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p318_047,We offered something different.
p318_048,We were very much a happy family.
p318_049,He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p318_050,My brother is buried under there.
p318_051,Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p318_052,What were they?
p318_053,It was large enough to fit the wall.
p318_054,He will be judged by his actions.
p318_055,Her role in it was small.
p318_056,I have really noticed that this week.
p318_057,We might be back next year.
p318_058,In a way he was.
p318_059,It's back to how it used to be.
p318_060,It is not a standing army.
p318_061,The firm was down and almost out.
p318_062,They said they were only young men.
p318_063,I was chosen to do this.
p318_064,I learned a lot from that.
p318_065,The house was so well alight.
p318_066,He got his degree.
p318_067,Sandy was very active.
p318_068,"However, there is great potential in this right."
p318_069,We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p318_070,I am confident of the outcome this week.
p318_071,There were no formal announcements.
p318_072,Before the games it was pretty open.
p318_073,It really has left the town in shock.
p318_074,But you can go beyond that condition.
p318_075,I'm so worried about the roads.
p318_076,This was much worse.
p318_077,He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p318_078,We are confident of taking that back.
p318_079,They must be kept on the ground.
p318_080,Did they give any good advice?
p318_081,Who wants to be a millionaire?
p318_082,This does not help.
p318_083,I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p318_084,That's why the ministers resigned.
p318_085,He has lost confidence and weight.
p318_086,This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p318_087,Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p318_088,This could be her way forward.
p318_089,This gives us a lot of practice.
p318_090,The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p318_091,"It's a very, very special day."
p318_092,The crucial strike was yet to come.
p318_093,There's also the point.
p318_094,It was forced to divert.
p318_095,"Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre."
p318_096,That's the National Grid.
p318_097,But Allen is deadly serious.
p318_098,Peter doesn't want to leave.
p318_099,He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p318_100,They have just got to believe in themselves.
p318_101,This is my personal assessment.
p318_102,There was no trouble at all.
p318_103,"Although, you never know."
p318_104,We shall be victorious.
p318_105,The quality of work is very impressive.
p318_106,"However, he added there were signs of progress."
p318_107,"Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer."
p318_108,I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p318_109,Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p318_110,I took the gun.
p318_111,It's just one of those things.
p318_112,A web site is planned for November.
p318_113,We played so well at times.
p318_114,I was very fortunate.
p318_115,Such a policy would be a disaster.
p318_116,We act because we must.
p318_117,They will be destroyed.
p318_118,We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p318_119,O Neill is reputed to have replied.
p318_120,The Tory party will last.
p318_121,It was a journey into a new life.
p318_122,It's a way of making a mark.
p318_123,There is a great carry over value.
p318_124,"Life, as many people know it, in other words."
p318_125,"I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes."
p318_126,What's the point?
p318_127,Why is this?
p318_128,What has changed since then?
p318_129,Raymond was always on the outside.
p318_130,We need to make more inquiries about that.
p318_131,I'd love to be at the World Cup.
p318_132,He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
p318_133,I am sorry to hear this news.
p318_134,"At some point, the bill will be presented."
p318_135,I mean it happens.
p318_136,This week is a perfect example.
p318_137,This performance has given my confidence a boost.
p318_138,Receiving this medal is an honour.
p318_139,"Sub Not Used, McCulloch."
p318_140,But every two minutes it was exploding.
p318_141,That sort of thing is long gone.
p318_142,It is typical of me.
p318_143,"However, consumers may take a different view."
p318_144,They played it like a cup final.
p318_145,"However, it is not all bad news for women."
p318_146,But the championship is not over yet.
p318_147,We haven't found out anything different.
p318_148,A review of the decision is being sought.
p318_149,"It will be about commitment, not compliance."
p318_150,"Still, in the end, it was a fair result."
p318_151,Surely it can do better than that?
p318_152,I am ashamed of them.
p318_153,"Glasgow, however, did not get a mention."
p318_154,The salary changes are long overdue.
p318_155,"I, like an idiot, agreed."
p318_156,"If so, we want to hear from them."
p318_157,I am not blaming audiences.
p318_158,Who was on the panel?
p318_159,They may differ on other issues.
p318_160,He had never run the distance before.
p318_161,I can make one further announcement.
p318_162,The General Election is all to play for.
p318_163,It was a fiery game.
p318_164,Agents and coaches must be paid.
p318_165,Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p318_166,"Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then."
p318_167,It will not be easy for him.
p318_168,This one is a special case.
p318_169,But what are the songs about?
p318_170,There is a simmering anger out there.
p318_171,The ministers are now to make their decision.
p318_172,That is not a position they enjoy.
p318_173,The stadium was full.
p318_174,Dewar is the medium.
p318_175,It was that kind of night.
p318_176,It is very much a matter for them.
p318_177,Perhaps it is jealousy.
p318_178,Any error is severely punished.
p318_179,He's got a great chance of making it.
p318_180,We won't do that.
p318_181,I hope we do.
p318_182,From now on there is no hiding place.
p318_183,I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p318_184,He quit in October.
p318_185,The United Nations must act.
p318_186,Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
p318_187,Her daughter is getting married.
p318_188,His manager blamed the referee.
p318_189,They were that poor.
p318_190,Patients will be partners in decision making.
p318_191,We have understood the problems for some time.
p318_192,Stan is a vital part of our future.
p318_193,All these things have an impact.
p318_194,That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p318_195,They believed it worked.
p318_196,"After that, though, we are still waiting to see."
p318_197,They should feel ashamed.
p318_198,This is a really serious issue.
p318_199,So they will settle again.
p318_200,How do we get more people in?
p318_201,I'm just looking to take my chances.
p318_202,It looks as though there is no chance.
p318_203,This is not a European Army.
p318_204,Election results are expected soon.
p318_205,So she told him.
p318_206,A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p318_207,"There are moments of honesty, too."
p318_208,It was good to score the goal today.
p318_209,The night is young.
p318_210,"Sadly, too, many of them are similar."
p318_211,I suspect that it will.
p318_212,But there's no eye contact.
p318_213,The squad will be the same for France.
p318_214,"We are a party for people, not against people."
p318_215,Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p318_216,We are still paying the price for that.
p318_217,"He did his best, but it wasn't good enough."
p318_218,It is not a wish list.
p318_219,"He's very, very lucky to be alive."
p318_220,Some of the players have not progressed.
p318_221,"It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident."
p318_222,"If not, he should go home."
p318_223,"We remain committed to it, as does the government."
p318_224,There is no margin for error.
p318_225,This was not an easy meeting for me.
p318_226,"From our point of view, it is the right time."
p318_227,That figure will always remain with me.
p318_228,And then a funny thing happened.
p318_229,It does not take much.
p318_230,She asked us a lot of questions.
p318_231,It was a stunning strike.
p318_232,It is a technique.
p318_233,They hold on for many years.
p318_234,Is it the shape of things to come?
p318_235,My body is exhausted.
p318_236,Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p318_237,We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
p318_238,There is nothing to fear.
p318_239,I was an athlete.
p318_240,Life was like a timetable.
p318_241,World leaders expressed their sympathy.
p318_242,I tried to push him away.
p318_243,It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p318_244,This was done by the council staff.
p318_245,The truth is otherwise.
p318_246,We haven't come out of this very well.
p318_247,I wanted to put myself on the line.
p318_248,I thought they could have made the gesture.
p318_249,We should be rewarded for producing.
p318_250,The bottom line is that this must stop.
p318_251,"Which, in effect, it is."
p318_252,The man became a reporter.
p318_253,It is a memorial.
p318_254,We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p318_255,Our people are paying high prices.
p318_256,The reason is partly because of tradition.
p318_257,Nor is it likely to do so.
p318_258,Or so everyone believed.
p318_259,Perhaps we should do the same.
p318_260,I read it every year.
p318_261,He was in contention almost every week.
p318_262,Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p318_263,It is up to Ann.
p318_264,We are playing them at their own game.
p318_265,By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p318_266,I had trouble with the producers.
p318_267,"So, it took me back to boarding school."
p318_268,They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p318_269,The conference is the first test.
p318_270,That's what we're trying to achieve.
p318_271,I expect a rapid response.
p318_272,There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p318_273,There is no more money.
p318_274,My mother is a widow.
p318_275,The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p318_276,There have been different reports from different people.
p318_277,It's an absolute disgrace.
p318_278,Something was plainly wrong.
p318_279,Why should he go anywhere?
p318_280,One thing is sure.
p318_281,It was a foolhardy decision.
p318_282,I'm confident we can do that.
p318_283,Funding needs to be long term.
p318_284,It's funny how it comes and goes.
p318_285,I would never even consider it.
p318_286,We are talking about the outskirts of London.
p318_287,The end result is precisely the same.
p318_288,We have it on video.
p318_289,I am not a threat to coaches.
p318_290,"Painful, but only because it's true."
p318_291,It's never over until it's over.
p318_292,"Colonel, About this committee that is coming."
p318_293,"This year, it was a little different."
p318_294,"That, though, is to miss the point."
p318_295,We gave them the goal.
p318_296,Is being naturally funny enough?
p318_297,What's the point of staying sober?
p318_298,We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p318_299,The incident is being taken seriously.
p318_300,"So what's the shape, and what's the detail?"
p318_301,"They were going through the motions, but that's about all."
p318_302,I can feel the sound inside.
p318_303,I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p318_304,I am not a fan of books.
p318_305,SO now we know the secret.
p318_306,It may well have been.
p318_307,I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p318_308,It was a simple question.
p318_309,I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
p318_310,And we have beaten them before.
p318_311,Could you put it in writing?
p318_312,I am not a paedophile.
p318_313,Some of their movement was excellent.
p318_314,But they had to be paid for.
p318_315,The odds are that it will.
p318_316,But then they scored their fourth.
p318_317,They deserve a lot of credit.
p318_318,That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p318_319,Why is that?
p318_320,Then came the crunch.
p318_321,But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p318_322,But will they fall in love?
p318_323,As if they ever stopped.
p318_324,The referee had a shocking game.
p318_325,Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p318_326,For a few years we had good fun.
p318_327,Medical staff are with them at the moment.
p318_328,It went on to become an annual event.
p318_329,This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p318_330,We are now in an election period.
p318_331,Everyone is too upset to comment.
p318_332,Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p318_333,But when we do it is great.
p318_334,She has nothing to say to journalists.
p318_335,I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p318_336,He pleaded for caution.
p318_337,I disagree entirely with the decision.
p318_338,They've been wonderful to me.
p318_339,I can't believe the buzz.
p318_340,I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p318_341,The picture is the same across Scotland.
p318_342,"When it comes down to it, this is a job."
p318_343,"It's no less intriguing, however."
p318_344,It's a question of perception.
p318_345,Staff have been informed.
p318_346,My heart is not so sure.
p318_347,This morning was very quiet.
p318_348,"On reflection, it was really quite exciting."
p318_349,It has been handled entirely properly.
p318_350,I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p318_351,That might help a bit.
p318_352,Two others were also seriously injured.
p318_353,He was made redundant in February last year.
p318_354,"Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots."
p318_355,"Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United."
p318_356,You have obviously got an answer to it.
p318_357,It seems very odd.
p318_358,Closure is not one of them.
p318_359,The hotel was huge.
p318_360,A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p318_361,"Well, you can have a tree."
p318_362,It was the same at Twickenham.
p318_363,This is an internal matter.
p318_364,I am amazed at what he's done.
p318_365,They took a risk.
p318_366,The idea was presented to me.
p318_367,The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p318_368,He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p318_369,His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p318_370,The hearing was fair.
p318_371,I see it as my job.
p318_372,This was not a summit about the euro.
p318_373,Frank Warren is a great man.
p318_374,I am a little bit tired.
p318_375,That was never their agenda.
p318_376,She died at her home.
p318_377,She is currently in foster care.
p318_378,That's the only thing that matters.
p318_379,I enjoy the creative process.
p318_380,They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p318_381,"It is, however, an unlikely outcome."
p318_382,"As it was a double, it was pretty expensive."
p318_383,"It's always the same, isn't it?"
p318_384,We have been preparing all year.
p318_385,We could learn a lot from them.
p318_386,I can't wait for the outdoors.
p318_387,"Sure, we have problems."
p318_388,I was released after six days.
p318_389,That time is not far away.
p318_390,I may think about performing it.
p318_391,There are a number of possible outcomes.
p318_392,We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p318_393,This is the last thing we ever expected.
p318_394,You can't go back and change things.
p318_395,It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p318_396,"Of course, it is a tough assignment."
p318_397,"Instead, it is back to the drawing board."
p318_398,He says it often enough.
p318_399,"Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good."
p318_400,His primary residence is Scotland.
p318_401,I found that much more challenging.
p318_402,This fight is not going to go away.
p318_403,It would have been very easily done.
p318_404,I will never manage another Scottish club.
p318_405,The Open champion is back.
p318_406,It's going to be a new challenge.
p318_407,"As, indeed, they would be."
p318_408,I want to keep him.
p318_409,He deserves a top team.
p318_410,I knew people on that committee.
p318_411,The next eight weeks are critical to us.
p318_412,"Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence."
p318_413,Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p318_414,We never agreed to it.
p318_415,But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p318_416,But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p318_417,Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p318_418,Would they work together again?
p318_419,I didn't play all that well.
p318_420,Who can tell?
p318_421,It appears to have been closed down.
