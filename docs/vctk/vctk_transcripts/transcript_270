p270_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p270_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p270_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p270_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p270_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p270_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p270_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p270_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p270_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p270_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p270_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p270_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p270_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p270_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p270_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p270_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p270_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p270_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p270_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p270_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p270_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p270_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p270_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p270_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
"
p270_025,"He was afraid to stay in hospital in Kosovo.
"

"
p270_027,"Smoking is also very important.
"
p270_028,"Allan Johnston was not match fit.
"
p270_029,"It was as if I had been stabbed.
"
p270_030,"He has the courage of the unaware.
"
p270_031,"Drugs are a serious problem.
"
p270_032,"We have to find a way to put that right.
"
p270_033,"That is the face of fear.
"
p270_034,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
"
p270_035,"Costs have got to be controlled.
"
p270_036,"He really is a lovely man.
"
p270_037,"There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
"
p270_038,"The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
"
p270_039,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p270_040,"The boy is no longer with us.
"
p270_041,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p270_042,"Merger would be entirely logical.
"
p270_043,"Must be prepared to use it.
"
p270_044,"Not if you know the person.
"
p270_045,"That was the theory, anyway.
"
p270_046,"I had come back from London.
"
p270_047,"I had trouble with the producers.
"
p270_048,"Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.

p270_049,"My fitness was very poor.
"
p270_050,"He also presented You Bet!
"
p270_051,"What do they want us to do ?
"
p270_052,"Is it worth it ?
"
p270_053,"Does it matter ?
"
p270_054,"How do you take them away ?
"
p270_055,"However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
"
p270_056,"After the match, do you ?
"
p270_057,"Because we do not need it.
"
p270_058,"The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
"
p270_059,"The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
"
p270_060,"We have not given up hope.
"
p270_061,"In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.

"
p270_074,"It is not in my nature.

"
p270_097,"But the battle has only just begun.
"

p270_116,"The problem was a social problem.

p270_117,"Figures are not relevant to the strategy.

p270_118,"You were made to feel so welcome.
"
p270_119,"You must always attempt to raise the bar.
"
p270_120,"You can spend money on housing.
"
p270_121,"It's not a quick fix.
"
p270_122,"That admission is not surprising.

p270_123,"Those people must be accountable.
"
p270_124,"I've never seen a game like it.
"
p270_125,"They keep the atmosphere in mind.

"
p270_134,"So what happens next ?
"
p270_135,"The abuse of elderly people was appalling.

p270_136,"But beyond a fairly minimal level it has little impact.

"
p270_138,"They made such decisions in London.
"
p270_139,"Italy was just behind the US.
"
p270_140,"The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
"
p270_141,"I feel very grateful with everything.
"
p270_142,"There was an element of frustration.
"
p270_143,"Before it was an ordeal.
"
p270_144,"I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
"
p270_145,"Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
"
p270_146,"Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
"
p270_147,"Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
"

"
p270_156,"We will turn the corner.
"
p270_157,"My Dad is a hero.
"
p270_158,"Do you think we are a top nation ?
"
p270_159,"Is our children learning ?
"
p270_160,"How independent is that ?
"
p270_161,"What form did that take ?
"
p270_162,"They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
"
p270_163,"There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
"
p270_164,"The woman was his wife.
"
p270_165,"This action reflects a slump in bookings.
"
p270_166,"Scotland came very close in the second Test.
"
p270_167,"We did what we had to do.
"
p270_168,"The strong performance is expected to continue.
"
p270_169,"She returned to the theatre.

"
p270_180,"City sentiment is in his favour.
"
p270_181,"I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
"
p270_182,"I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
"
p270_183,"Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
"
p270_184,"For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
"
p270_185,"It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
"
p270_186,"They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
"
p270_187,"They receive a high profile in the media.
"
p270_188,"That's not fair to the supporters.
"
p270_189,"They bought the property four years ago.
"
p270_190,"They need to look after themselves.
"
p270_191,"Miller was every bit as happy.
"
p270_192,"You know the sort of thing.
"
p270_193,"They were seriously after him.
"
p270_194,"Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
"
p270_195,"We represent a wide range of society.
"
p270_196,"Motorists will buy passes in advance.
"
p270_197,"It's very difficult to find a buyer.
"
p270_198,"I know every village and island on the west coast.
"
p270_199,"Mr Blair was ready for him.
"
p270_200,"He should emerge as the winner.
"
p270_201,"In France, the reverse is true.
"
p270_202,"I came home by ambulance.
"
p270_203,"It comes from reflection or thinking.
"
p270_204,"They have the cash and the fire power.
"
p270_205,"We believe a third party was involved.
"
p270_206,"The early physical reports were clear.
"
p270_207,"The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
"
p270_208,"Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
"
p270_209,"The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
"
p270_210,"This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.
"
p270_211,"I am very realistic about these things.
"
p270_212,"British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
"
p270_213,"They are looking at a flotation.
"
p270_214,"There can be no compromise on that demand.
"
p270_215,"Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
"
p270_216,"It would appear to be a good time to invest.
"
p270_217,"HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
"
p270_218,"From there, they can go anywhere.
"
p270_219,"There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
"
p270_220,"It had all been arranged.
"
p270_221,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p270_222,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p270_223,"Is it in the right place ?
"
p270_224,"Did he trip ?
"
p270_225,"Does that put pressure on us ?
"
p270_226,"It was finally agreed on Saturday.
"
p270_227,"Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
"
p270_228,"They are difficult awards to decide.
"
p270_229,"I am considered a teenager.
"
p270_230,"There's a chance they might come down.
"
p270_231,"Yet the evidence is plain to see.
"
p270_232,"There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
"
p270_233,"I wouldn't even respond to that question.
"
p270_234,"People should make their own decisions.
"
p270_235,"Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
"
p270_236,"They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
"
p270_237,"That was a real challenge.
"

"
p270_239,"The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
"
p270_240,"We were a shambles at the back.
"
p270_241,"The scientific debate is dead.
"
p270_242,"They are the innocent victims.
"
p270_243,"You should always be able to get out in some direction.
"
p270_244,"Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
"
p270_245,"This would include the GM food industry.
"
p270_246,"And he goes with it.
"
p270_247,"It had so much to do with output.
"
p270_248,"Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
"
p270_249,"That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
"
p270_250,"The irony was not lost.
"
p270_251,"I might get an injury very easily.
"
p270_252,"It might be sad, but it's a fact.
"
p270_253,"Everything depends on the weather.
"
p270_254,"This is a historic occasion.
"
p270_255,"This championship is different from the other majors.
"
p270_256,"Labour was too busy to respond.
"
p270_257,"I was just getting over the time difference.
"
p270_258,"I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
"
p270_259,"Either way, the investor retains the premium.
"
p270_260,"There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
"
p270_261,"You're not getting any goodwill.
"
p270_262,"Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
"
p270_263,"No production contract is yet in sight.
"
p270_264,"Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
"
p270_265,"A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
"
p270_266,"We accept the new rules.
"
p270_267,"It is probably in the culture.
"
p270_268,"He took over our lives.
"
p270_269,"I'd never run for them.
"
p270_270,"how do you get it back ?
"
p270_271,"What are you not good at ?
"
p270_272,"I think, therefore I am ?
"
p270_273,"Who was she ?
"
p270_274,"Or was it ?
"
p270_275,"And they were being paid ?
"
p270_276,"These figures are truly terrible.
"
p270_277,"The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
"
p270_278,"He could see no other bidder.
"
p270_279,"There's not much money in cycling.
"
p270_280,"None of this work is guaranteed.
"
p270_281,"This could put pressure on UK inflation.
"
p270_282,"Any error is severely punished.
"
p270_283,"Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
"
p270_284,"I understand the security issue.
"
p270_285,"It left me with a sadness.
"
p270_286,"Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
"
p270_287,"The target is to break even by Christmas.
"
p270_288,"It was never a free kick.
"
p270_289,"The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
"
p270_290,"It involved the same people.
"
p270_291,"She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
"
p270_292,"You have to expect this type of thing.
"
p270_293,"There's always the next century.
"
p270_294,"It's hard to see it.
"
p270_295,"The partnership was set up during the summer.
"
p270_296,"Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
"
p270_297,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p270_298,"I intended to look for another club on loan.
"
p270_299,"Maloney is an engaging talent.
"
p270_300,"We would hope to make progress on that next year.
"
p270_301,"The rescue package is public money.
"
p270_302,"He was overwhelmed by the response.
"
p270_303,"The effect was almost magical.
"
p270_304,"It would be great to win the title again.
"
p270_305,"It could well be military.
"
p270_306,"Selection is not in my hands at all.
"
p270_307,"His day had started much like any other Sunday.
"
p270_308,"The songs are just so good.
"
p270_309,"Sunday's game was not a trial.
"
p270_310,"Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
"
p270_311,"The world record is suspicious.
"
p270_312,"There was no hint of scandal.
"
p270_313,"I was brought up in a mining background.
"
p270_314,"Job losses were also announced.
"
p270_315,"A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
"
p270_316,"It is a road of death.
"
p270_317,"The pound has also suffered.
"
p270_318,"He has left the company.
"
p270_319,"What happened in that game ?
"
p270_320,"Are you going to win ?
"
p270_321,"Was it the wife ?
"
p270_322,"Why change it ?
"
p270_323,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p270_324,"Does the name matter ?
"
p270_325,"People can really get themselves in a mess.
"
p270_326,"Survival is not an option.
"
p270_327,"There will be good prospects ahead.
"
p270_328,"Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
"
p270_329,"It is a court case.
"
p270_330,"This isn't the end of story.
"
p270_331,"It will set the tone.
"
p270_332,"He will go a long way.
"
p270_333,"It is far too early.
"
p270_334,"The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
"
p270_335,"The Premier League has been a huge success.
"
p270_336,"Age is not like other forms of discrimination.

p270_337,"The next week is crucial.
"
p270_338,"Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
"
p270_339,"My body is clearly capable.
"
p270_340,"It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
"
p270_341,"There was some merit in that.
"
p270_342,"They were impressive against France.
"
p270_343,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p270_344,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p270_345,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p270_346,"And does it ?
"
p270_347,"Are you from the rugby ?
"
p270_348,"He declined to comment on possible disposals.
"
p270_349,"Nobody said it was required.
"
p270_350,"This statement has never been withdrawn.
"
p270_351,"It was tough to contain the excitement.
"
p270_352,"Whether this return was too soon.
"
p270_353,"Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
"
p270_354,"There is a good example in this city.
"
p270_355,"It's wonderful to have won.
"
