p244_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p244_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p244_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p244_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p244_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p244_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p244_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p244_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p244_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p244_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p244_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p244_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p244_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p244_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p244_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p244_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p244_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p244_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p244_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p244_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p244_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p244_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p244_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p244_025,"We are a service industry.
"
p244_026,"It may be good for the soul.
"
p244_027,"We want to lift the cup for the fans.
"
p244_028,"I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
"
p244_029,"It is about investing in the future.
"
p244_030,"However, the following year the cancer returned.
"
p244_031,"They were in good humour, too.
"
p244_032,"The end result is the same.
"
p244_033,"It is on the internet.
"
p244_034,"These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
"
p244_035,"IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
"
p244_036,"This is a central issue.
"
p244_037,"History is in the making.
"
p244_038,"Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
"
p244_039,"She was there for the start of the campaign.
"
p244_040,"She was at the top.
"
p244_041,"In London today, it was business as usual.
"
p244_042,"And they had a case.
"
p244_043,"Something has to be put in place.
"
p244_044,"If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
"
p244_045,"They are going after them.
"
p244_046,"It is all about the story.
"
p244_047,"The whole thing is the music.
"
p244_048,"In fact, they are the future of investment.
"
p244_049,"That is still the case.
"
p244_050,"At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
"
p244_051,"In my view, it has to be done.
"
p244_052,"The pressure on the players will build.
"
p244_053,"Their campaign is in disarray.
"
p244_054,"But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
"
p244_055,"Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
"
p244_056,"It has been a horrible, horrible time.
"
p244_057,"Clearly, they had other problems.
"
p244_058,"This trend is likely to strengthen.
"
p244_059,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p244_060,"We have got to deliver.
"
p244_061,"That was the difference today.
"
p244_062,"The company continues to grow.
"
p244_063,"He said it was for sale.
"
p244_064,"We felt it was sufficient.
"
p244_065,"That is all in the past.
"
p244_066,"There is a lot to be done.
"
p244_067,"But that's another story for another day.
"
p244_068,"He has not been dropped.
"
p244_069,"It was an outstanding performance.
"
p244_070,"I can't remember a lot about the accident.
"
p244_071,"Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
"
p244_072,"It is only the beginning.
"
p244_073,"Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
"
p244_074,"Only water is currently allowed.
"
p244_075,"This time, it might be for real.
"
p244_076,"She did that for the rest of her life.
"
p244_077,"Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
"
p244_078,"That will be the office.
"
p244_079,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p244_080,"How are you, sir ?
"
p244_081,"So is that it, then ?
"
p244_082,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p244_083,"What do we do ?
"
p244_084,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p244_085,"It starts with the script.
"
p244_086,"Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
"
p244_087,"It would have been around the turn of the century.
"
p244_088,"I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
"
p244_089,"Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
"
p244_090,"It seems a good thing to try.
"
p244_091,"However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
"
p244_092,"It sounds a lot of money.
"
p244_093,"However, a ruling will not come before next week.
"
p244_094,"It is not a story.
"
p244_095,"However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
"
p244_096,"He is in the US.
"
p244_097,"I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
"
p244_098,"It took an option on the process.
"
p244_099,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p244_100,"This is a game of confidence.
"
p244_101,"On Saturday, it was much the same.
"
p244_102,"He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
"
p244_103,"The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.
"
p244_104,"The trick is to try it.
"
p244_105,"I had no intention of misleading anyone.
"
p244_106,"Victory was never in doubt.
"
p244_107,"This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
"
p244_108,"On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.
"
p244_109,"Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
"
p244_110,"Then again, we could have.
"
p244_111,"There, you were just a body.
"
p244_112,"But he has not become a monster.
"
p244_113,"He is not a dancer.
"
p244_114,"We had planned to sell the property for some time.
"
p244_115,"A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
"
p244_116,"In the end we have to take a stand.
"
p244_117,"This is a sea change in approach.
"
p244_118,"Otherwise, the market may come back.
"
p244_119,"The procedures were not in place.
"
p244_120,"For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
"
p244_121,"In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
"
p244_122,"He was not alone at the top of the board.
"
p244_123,"The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
"
p244_124,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p244_125,"We had a great time.
"
p244_126,"I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
"
p244_127,"According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
"
p244_128,"It was far from business as usual.
"
p244_129,"He wanted to record the group.
"
p244_130,"He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
"
p244_131,"Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
"
p244_132,"It is hard to believe.
"
p244_133,"Or it would have been.
"
p244_134,"Three days later, he was killed.
"
p244_135,"Football is a passion for many.
"
p244_136,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p244_137,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p244_138,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p244_139,"And does it ?
"
p244_140,"Are you from the rugby ?
"
p244_141,"However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
"
p244_142,"That was the first step.
"
p244_143,"However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
"
p244_144,"I have been in contact with him.
"
p244_145,"Actors like to be in the centre.
"
p244_146,"When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
"
p244_147,"They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
"
p244_148,"I am the manager of Scotland.
"
p244_149,"There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
"
p244_150,"There were no grounds for his action.
"
p244_151,"I can't even get into the A team.
"
p244_152,"It starts at the top.
"
p244_153,"Others are expected to follow the lead.
"
p244_154,"She does not want to speak.
"
p244_155,"It was all for good reason as well.
"
p244_156,"One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
"
p244_157,"It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
"
p244_158,"As for the warning, it was not needed.
"
p244_159,"If not, a deal could take many months.
"
p244_160,"We want to get there.
"
p244_161,"On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
"
p244_162,"There is a lack of staff.
"
p244_163,"Not that the occasion was without restraint.
"
p244_164,"Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
"
p244_165,"This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
"
p244_166,"At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
"
p244_167,"Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
"
p244_168,"Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
"
p244_169,"Anyone can do the sums.
"
p244_170,"We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.
"
p244_171,"It is not about the money, it is about everything.
"
p244_172,"Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
"
p244_173,"We were all over the place in the first half.
"
p244_174,"Like the others, he was arrested.
"
p244_175,"All the pressure was on him.
"
p244_176,"Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
"
p244_177,"They have not been named.
"
p244_178,"It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
"
p244_179,"I think the Labour party is completely split on this.
"
p244_180,"It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
"
p244_181,"I was always in control.
"
p244_182,"It was by the numbers.
"
p244_183,"I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
"
p244_184,"It should never have happened.
"
p244_185,"Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
"
p244_186,"The feeling is hard to describe.
"
p244_187,"It is difficult to say.
"
p244_188,"That is a question for the next manager.
"
p244_189,"By then, however, both men were already in the US.
"
p244_190,"However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
"
p244_191,"It is simply not true.
"
p244_192,"Are you going to win ?
"
p244_193,"Was it the wife ?
"
p244_194,"Why change it ?
"
p244_195,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p244_196,"Does the name matter ?
"
p244_197,"That you can do it.
"
p244_198,"I would like to continue to develop.
"
p244_199,"First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
"
p244_200,"He has defended the system.
"
p244_201,"We want to begin a programme in the UK.
"
p244_203,"At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
"
p244_204,"It is not an issue.
"
p244_205,"They have to get that sorted.
"
p244_206,"We can take the city.
"
p244_207,"He played it like a veteran.
"
p244_208,"It was the story of the second half.
"
p244_209,"Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
"
p244_210,"As many as the market will support.
"
p244_211,"He is believed to live in Britain.
"
p244_212,"Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
"
p244_213,"The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
"
p244_214,"This conference was never confirmed.
"
p244_215,"A team is a team.
"
p244_216,"However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
"
p244_217,"I'm interested in interesting work.
"
p244_218,"It decided to blame the media.
"
p244_219,"THE force is with them.
"
p244_220,"This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
"
p244_221,"It was important to win today.
"
p244_222,"He was not injured in the attack.
"
p244_223,"Because he was born in England.
"
p244_224,"Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
"
p244_225,"Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.
"
p244_226,"I was not overly concerned about this.
"
p244_227,"However, it is not as simple as this.
"
p244_228,"We want this place to work.
"
p244_229,"It still has an effect.
"
p244_230,"The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
"
p244_231,"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
"
p244_232,"Other villages were completely deserted.
"
p244_233,"There is a lot of concern.
"
p244_234,"It will be decided in the next month.
"
p244_235,"We have to win the group.
"
p244_236,"It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
"
p244_237,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p244_238,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p244_239,"There was a lot of resentment.
"
p244_240,"This is a fight to the death.
"
p244_241,"All will be revealed in due course.
"
p244_242,"He is a man of the people.
"
p244_243,"The matter is under appeal.
"
p244_244,"And they were being paid ?
"
p244_245,"was everything done to save people ?
"
p244_246,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p244_247,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p244_248,"Is it in the right place ?
"
p244_249,"Did he trip ?
"
p244_250,"Sadly, it could not be done.
"
p244_251,"I wouldn't even respond to that question.
"
p244_252,"Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
"
p244_253,"Instead, he missed the lot.
"
p244_254,"I was never in danger.
"
p244_255,"A lot has been written.
"
p244_256,"In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
"
p244_257,"It was really good in the first week.
"
p244_258,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p244_259,"However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.
"
p244_260,"That is not the case in Europe.
"
p244_261,"But it was a loss.
"
p244_262,"So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
"
p244_263,"The performance continues to improve.
"
p244_264,"It expected this trend to continue.
"
p244_265,"However, no further action was taken by police.
"
p244_266,"It depends on Labour, not on us.
"
p244_267,"But we were in control at that point.
"
p244_268,"It has to be enforced.
"
p244_269,"The party has never fully recovered.
"
p244_270,"Moreover, it must be for all sports.
"
p244_271,"But the government has so far failed to listen.
"
p244_272,"He must have a crack at it.
"
p244_273,"I am still waiting for a reply.
"
p244_274,"Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
"
p244_275,"He was good, but not that good.
"
p244_276,"The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
"
p244_277,"Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
"
p244_278,"However, the matter is not going to end there.
"
p244_279,"It might be sad, but it's a fact.
"
p244_280,"In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
"
p244_281,"Obviously, we would want to look at this.
"
p244_282,"On a practical level, it would be difficult.
"
p244_283,"If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
"
p244_284,"It is important that he is involved.
"
p244_285,"If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
"
p244_286,"It should be noted that he has been released without charge.
"
p244_287,"In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
"
p244_288,"Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
"
p244_290,"I should think so, too.
"
p244_291,"None of the agencies was able to help.
"
p244_292,"I didn't see the point.
"
p244_293,"This idea has been around for four years.
"
p244_294,"We are in a war.
"
p244_295,"Do you think we are a top nation ?
"
p244_296,"Is our children learning ?
"
p244_297,"How independent is that ?
"
p244_298,"What form did that take ?
"
p244_299,"Are they free ?
"
p244_300,"Scotland won by six wickets.
"
p244_301,"However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
"
p244_302,"This is a historic agreement.
"
p244_303,"We have to be realistic.
"
p244_304,"Every one is a winner.
"
p244_305,"There was a hole in it.
"
p244_306,"It will be done in stages.
"
p244_307,"It all started with a visiting rugby club.
"
p244_308,"Every character was completely different.
"
p244_309,"But it is a similar problem.
"
p244_310,"In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.
"
p244_311,"But it is important for a number of reasons.
"
p244_312,"In that moment, I was happy.
"
p244_313,"All of the management has invested in the firm.
"
p244_314,"It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
"
p244_315,"They were not at the property yesterday.
"
p244_316,"It involved the same people.
"
p244_317,"We want to get back into the Champions League.
"
p244_318,"We have to be very, very careful.
"
p244_319,"Look at the potential of this club.
"
p244_320,"Hopefully, this week will be good.
"
p244_321,"This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
"
p244_322,"We did something about it.
"
p244_323,"But it is up again.
"
p244_324,"However, the devil is in the detail.
"
p244_325,"For the moment, however, the position is clear.
"
p244_326,"The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
"
p244_327,"He is already in place.
"
p244_328,"Another difference is the cost.
"
p244_329,"Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
"
p244_330,"And we can do it.
"
p244_331,"What are they for ?
"
p244_333,"Do they think anyone else wants them ?
"
p244_334,"Tax is a matter for national governments.
"
p244_335,"And it's a goodbye from him.
"
p244_336,"It is a sensitive issue.
"
p244_337,"They have to be addressed.
"
p244_338,"This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
"
p244_339,"Like many companies, it is a problem.
"
p244_340,"The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.
"
p244_341,"However, a bid was never made.
"
p244_342,"That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
"
p244_343,"Something is going to have to give.
"
p244_344,"And the context is also completely different.
"
p244_345,"The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
"
p244_346,"The banking sector was weak.
"
p244_347,"But the New Year was special.
"
p244_348,"We never played at all.
"
p244_349,"However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
"
p244_350,"This isn't the end of story.
"
p244_351,"He is a great prospect.
"
p244_352,"He has been told by the doctor to rest.
"
p244_353,"However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
"
