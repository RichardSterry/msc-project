p326_001,Please call Stella.
p326_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p326_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p326_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p326_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p326_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p326_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p326_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p326_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p326_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p326_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p326_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p326_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p326_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p326_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p326_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p326_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p326_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p326_019,"Since then physicists have found it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p326_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p326_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p326_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p326_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p326_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p326_025,"Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George."
p326_026,The message was clear.
p326_027,She is an angel.
p326_028,It is believed he had been stabbed.
p326_029,We have got to attack.
p326_030,"I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing."
p326_031,United were in control without always being dominant.
p326_032,There we were on the first tee.
p326_033,Roy Keane is certainly the best.
p326_034,At least two women were among those arrested.
p326_035,How would it work?
p326_036,It was my shortest audition.
p326_037,That was a stunning drive from Jon.
p326_038,She didn't tell us anything new.
p326_039,There is nothing like this back home.
p326_040,The police believe the man was not injured.
p326_041,It would be a miracle.
p326_042,We just love to chat.
p326_043,I read about it in the newspapers.
p326_044,What did they think of her voice?
p326_045,They say they feel different.
p326_046,It is a good result for Great Britain.

p326_053,Labour was too busy to respond.

p326_061,Mr Blunkett was convinced.
p326_062,"For the other parties, it is back to business as usual."

p326_064,It was a foolhardy decision.
p326_065,Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p326_066,"Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape."
p326_067,There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p326_068,Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
p326_069,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good."
p326_070,Messages have to be reinforced.
p326_071,The success story shows no signs of stopping.
p326_072,Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.

p326_076,I was shocked and outraged.
p326_077,It's just gotten too big.

p326_081,The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.

p326_085,Chelsea was a great club.
p326_086,I can't believe it.
p326_087,"I couldn't believe it, but it looks like it's true."
p326_088,We have them in offices all over.
p326_089,It need not be like that.
p326_090,There has been a sense of frustration.
p326_091,"At that time, there was no infection within five miles."
p326_092,"Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention."
p326_093,"This time, there were no such rewards."

p326_095,"It is, honestly, difficult to write about this."
p326_096,We are very very proud of Alain.
p326_097,"Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over."
p326_098,It was exactly four months away.
p326_099,"The performance, for this listener, didn't come off."
p326_100,It was set in a cafe.
p326_101,It certainly gives you hope.
p326_102,"If he does not leave, he will be shot."
p326_103,"Brown is an interesting man, but he's not desperate."
p326_104,We've all been there at some point.
p326_105,I'm totally horrified by the sentence.
p326_106,Our people should be immune.
p326_107,It's a metaphor for consumption.
p326_108,I just saw them for a few minutes.
p326_109,"A management agreement, however, was conceded."

p326_119,She has now been registered as disabled.
p326_120,Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p326_121,"Last night, he pledged to clear his name."
p326_122,It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p326_123,That is a data management problem.
p326_124,Nor is he allowed out without permission.
p326_125,He looked very sharp.
p326_126,Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p326_127,I've beaten her a few times.
p326_128,His father and mother are in film production.
p326_129,This is not a long-term commitment.

p326_131,They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
p326_132,Yet she is one of the lucky ones.
p326_133,Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.

p326_141,We are not going to forget.
p326_142,I'm the one that said it.
p326_143,It's not hard to get involved.
p326_144,I've grown up a bit.
p326_145,For a moment it was all about her.
p326_146,It changed my life.
p326_147,Once they go away they won't come back.
p326_148,It's a difficult one to comment on.
p326_149,Our position is clear.
p326_150,Yet it does not lose appeal.
p326_151,But what will we put on it?
p326_152,Then in came a succession of signings.
p326_153,It will benefit a lot of people.
p326_154,A new school will be built.
p326_155,The main thing is that they enjoy it.

p326_157,I felt he was excellent.
p326_158,It's not just a male agenda.
p326_159,This meeting is the path to salvation.
p326_160,I think we believed the tie was won.
p326_161,She wanted to move.
p326_162,How do you find the youngsters?
p326_163,It's always a rehearsal.
p326_164,But it's a subtle process.
p326_165,We all have to look in the mirror.
p326_166,There is no internal damage.

p326_174,We are already under pressure.
p326_175,She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p326_176,"In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge."

p326_214,It's not long enough.

p326_217,He scored a touchdown.
p326_218,They finished second and third.
p326_219,We're playing away from home and that's it.
p326_220,He was then replaced by Ross.
p326_221,"It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either."
p326_222,I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p326_223,She did not attend the courtroom.
p326_224,People can get them if they want.
p326_225,Smith confirmed that their confidence was returning.
p326_226,He is a law unto himself.
p326_227,"I was very, very happy."
p326_228,No-one should see that.
p326_229,We are going to go about our lives.
p326_230,What is the point of jailing him?
p326_231,They made it very difficult for us.
p326_232,"Well, there is a bed."
p326_233,You write a play.
p326_234,There are no easy solutions to this problem.
p326_235,The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p326_236,Seems a sensible compromise.
p326_237,This kind of traffic is commonplace.

p326_246,I've been thinking about it for a year.
p326_247,Scotland were on Saturday.

p326_255,I got a yellow card.
p326_256,My game just seems to keep on improving.
p326_257,We would expect it to disappear in time.

p326_265,But there are some problems.
p326_266,It may also be her last.
p326_267,It should not lose out in any way.
p326_268,We're very pleased about the verdict.
p326_269,It will not be a long campaign.

p326_271,Maybe it helps us.
p326_272,Three bystanders were killed.
p326_273,"We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again."
p326_274,"However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate."
p326_275,Was it just negligent.
p326_276,He made no big mistakes.
p326_277,"It will not be today, though."
p326_278,Which is a shame.
p326_279,That is where our future lies.
p326_280,There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p326_281,Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p326_282,That was enough for the committee.

p326_287,We have to focus on what is important.
p326_288,They have to work so hard.
p326_289,But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p326_290,"Well, was it?"
p326_291,That's my big challenge.
p326_292,The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p326_293,We have to adapt to this level.
p326_294,So what is it with Nato?
p326_295,We won't let you down.
p326_296,"Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?"

p326_303,It is a simple equation.
p326_304,It makes a huge difference.

p326_306,"She has seen, or heard, it all."
p326_307,Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
p326_308,Could you put it in writing?
p326_309,They play together perfectly.
p326_310,We will meet again.
p326_311,"It's a record label, not a form of music."
p326_312,The other conditions were not specified.
p326_313,They should use it on the catwalk.
p326_314,Perhaps it is the Crown Estate.
p326_315,We're looking at the Citizens Theatre the Lyceum.
p326_316,It certainly sounded it at times.
p326_317,Anyone can take a photo.
p326_318,"We were very happy with our results, which were excellent."
p326_319,They treated me with respect and courtesy.
p326_320,He is involved in everything.
p326_321,"Family, if you like."
p326_322,A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p326_323,I don't want to change anything.
p326_324,I've only met him three times.
p326_325,"You see, my back has gone."
p326_326,It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p326_327,Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p326_328,We are the weakest link.
p326_329,It had been on the cards.
p326_330,"She looked very, very poor."
p326_331,"He did, and he missed."
p326_332,Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
p326_333,Many innocent people will die.
p326_334,The mood was defiant.
p326_335,We have now no choice.
p326_336,I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p326_337,Butcher has only one idea in mind.
p326_338,It's our worst nightmare.
p326_339,We gave them the goal.
p326_340,Self control is just one instalment.
p326_341,It would be a massive boost for them.
p326_342,You never had it so good.
p326_343,Both are national treasures.
p326_344,The then secretary was not amused.
p326_345,I can't speak for him.
p326_346,It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p326_347,Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p326_348,I can't see him reversing that.
p326_349,He was on a horse.
p326_350,I'm really looking forward to it.
p326_351,Capital gains tax is also being reduced.
p326_352,"I think, at last, the company will find itself again."
p326_353,And that gives a kind of freedom.
p326_354,I have also been delighted with Stevie.
p326_355,He's on the wrong side.
p326_356,"If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help."
p326_357,My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p326_358,Labour is providing none of these.
p326_359,"So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy."
p326_360,There is no musical background in his family.
p326_361,"However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work."
p326_362,The mix with Tiger is perfect.
p326_363,There were no immediate reports of injuries.
p326_364,"Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him."
p326_366,Finally action had been taken.
p326_367,We're not travel agents.
p326_368,It's hard not to.
p326_369,Broke down and can't be fixed.
p326_370,I'm desperate to play in this match.
p326_371,"That's always the case, isn't it?"
p326_372,"However, there are no plans for injecting rooms."
p326_373,"Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds."
p326_374,It is patently true.
p326_375,They did not threaten anyone.
p326_376,"There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers."
p326_377,That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p326_378,But sometimes it works out all right.
p326_379,"What are you supposed to do, just walk away?"
p326_380,Even then he was in the media spotlight.
p326_381,Therein lies the problem.
p326_382,You feel the pride.
p326_383,But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
p326_384,The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p326_385,I have to keep working hard.
p326_386,"Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time."
p326_387,Art is still a risky investment.
p326_388,That is difficult to answer.
p326_389,"A century on, little has changed."
p326_390,Wrong decisions Address in full
p326_391,My father had been unwell for many years.
p326_392,She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p326_393,It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p326_394,"However, his remarks were heavily qualified."
p326_395,It was like the old days.
p326_396,A great deal has been achieved.
p326_397,My future is in the marathon.
p326_398,Then he did it twice.
p326_399,So is the rest of British sport.
p326_400,It had until tomorrow to comply.
