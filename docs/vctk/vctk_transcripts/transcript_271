p271_001,"Please call Stella.  
"
p271_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p271_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p271_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p271_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p271_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p271_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p271_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p271_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p271_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p271_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p271_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p271_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p271_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p271_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p271_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p271_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p271_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p271_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p271_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p271_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p271_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p271_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p271_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p271_025,"She looked so young.
"
p271_026,"We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
"
p271_027,"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
"
p271_028,"I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
"
p271_029,"They have no history.
"
p271_030,"However, the following year the cancer returned.
"
p271_031,"Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
"
p271_032,"I'd just like to play.
"
p271_033,"This is the window.
"
p271_034,"I feel I did not have enough time.
"
p271_035,"We speak about the performance.
"
p271_036,"IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
"
p271_037,"It was clear.
"
p271_038,"Indeed, he does.
"
p271_039,"People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
"
p271_040,"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
"
p271_041,"It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
"
p271_042,"We will push.
"
p271_043,"I hate the word.
"
p271_044,"They said she was stable.
"
p271_045,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p271_046,"Is a drug dealer?
"
p271_047,"There is no reason at all.
"
p271_048,"He is too weak to move.
"
p271_049,"They were on holiday in Egypt.
"
p271_050,"Every aspect of our play was first class.
"
p271_051,"No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
"
p271_052,"Here's a clue.
"
p271_053,"Her body was found about four miles from the car.
"
p271_054,"I guess I was lucky, though.
"
p271_055,"I was inspired by two things.
"
p271_056,"For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
"
p271_057,"I love the Dome.
"
p271_058,"It's so awful.
"
p271_059,"It is unique.
"
p271_060,"I expect a rapid response.
"
p271_061,"That's the truth.
"
p271_062,"Jobs could go.
"
p271_063,"We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
"
p271_064,"Scotland had great assets.
"
p271_065,"It's that kind of place.
"
p271_066,"They are real.
"
p271_067,"It's good news and long overdue.
"
p271_068,"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
"
p271_069,"We should have known.
"
p271_070,"Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
"
p271_071,"Try to save us.
"
p271_072,"He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
"
p271_073,"He was at home with his pals.
"
p271_074,"It's all I can do.
"
p271_075,"There could be a way back.
"
p271_076,"Then followed a bout of flu.
"
p271_077,"Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
"
p271_078,"Neither it is.
"
p271_079,"Is there a new way forward?
"
p271_080,"The party is up for it.
"
p271_081,"Even the one she loved.
"
p271_082,"He is in the queue.
"
p271_083,"He is driven.
"
p271_084,"A play is a set of actions.
"
p271_085,"Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
"
p271_086,"Someone who cares
"
p271_087,"By then, he was walking on water.
"
p271_088,"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
"
p271_089,"They lived for their children.
"
p271_090,"The city council is a major property owner in the area.
"
p271_091,"Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
"
p271_092,"It is a lifeline.
"
p271_093,"Maloney is an engaging talent.
"
p271_094,"He was possessed
"
p271_095,"I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
"
p271_096,"This one did.
"
p271_097,"Then came the crunch.
"
p271_098,"It is annoying.
"
p271_099,"It is home-grown.
"
p271_100,"They are now divorced.
"
p271_101,"I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
"
p271_102,"I saw the whole thing.
"
p271_103,"However, we have not come to any conclusions.
"
p271_104,"I'm not looking for a breakthrough.
"
p271_105,"It is a love affair.
"
p271_106,"They make a selective perception process.
"
p271_107,"That would be unlawful.
"
p271_108,"We have an election in eight days.
"
p271_109,"He takes the job.
"
p271_110,"She reflects a bit.
"
p271_111,"The cause of the fire is not yet known.
"
p271_112,"Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
"
p271_113,"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
"
p271_114,"I am an actor.
"
p271_115,"He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
"
p271_116,"It was the eighties.
"
p271_117,"I did not see any reason to change the captain.
"
p271_118,"It is so sad.
"
p271_119,"You had better believe it.
"
p271_120,"It's not fair.
"
p271_121,"Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
"
p271_122,"That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
"
p271_123,"Who would have?
"
p271_124,"We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
"
p271_125,"His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
"
p271_126,"The people will come.
"
p271_127,"The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
"
p271_128,"The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
"
p271_129,"The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
"
p271_130,"We work well together.
"
p271_131,"What will happen then?
"
p271_132,"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
"
p271_133,"Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
"
p271_134,"Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
"
p271_135,"It was very frightened and dirty.
"
p271_136,"Is that it?
"
p271_137,"My daughter is an adult.
"
p271_138,"He should resign.
"
p271_139,"I was dead.
"
p271_140,"If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
"
p271_141,"It seems so long since I did the exams.
"
p271_142,"Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
"
p271_143,"And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
"
p271_144,"She died at her home.
"
p271_145,"He realises his mistake.
"
p271_146,"Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
"
p271_147,"I was awful.
"
p271_148,"He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
"
p271_149,"Note the date.
"
p271_150,"So I got a blood test.
"
p271_151,"It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
"
p271_152,"The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
"
p271_153,"The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
"
p271_154,"The weather forecast isn't good.
"
p271_155,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p271_156,"Work has started.
"
p271_157,"My Dad is a hero.
"
p271_158,"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
"
p271_159,"Words were not required.
"
p271_160,"Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
"
p271_161,"That includes the equipment?
"
p271_162,"These days are long gone.
"
p271_163,"I'd love to be like Peter.
"
p271_164,"It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
"
p271_165,"It has to be now.
"
p271_166,"I haven't had a lesson in four years.
"
p271_167,"As, indeed, they would be.
"
p271_168,"Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
"
p271_169,"They are not advertised.
"
p271_170,"The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
"
p271_171,"Tell it like it was?
"
p271_172,"It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
"
p271_173,"We have a budget in March.
"
p271_174,"By then, however, both men were already in the US.
"
p271_175,"You had to go and see him.
"
p271_176,"It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
"
p271_177,"It is really good news.
"
p271_178,"He was a crazy man.
"
p271_179,"They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
"
p271_180,"One season, they might do well.
"
p271_181,"As we worked.
"
p271_182,"However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
"
p271_183,"The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
"
p271_184,"If that's the case, he will struggle.
"
p271_185,"I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
"
p271_186,"The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
"
p271_187,"The goals were good.
"
p271_188,"I've been there.
"
p271_189,"And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
"
p271_190,"It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
"
p271_191,"I saw military vehicles in the distance.
"
p271_192,"What has caused the demise of singing?
"
p271_193,"One was a lawyer.
"
p271_194,"A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
"
p271_195,"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
"
p271_196,"However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
"
p271_197,"Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
"
p271_198,"I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
"
p271_199,"It is a farce.
"
p271_200,"It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
"
p271_201,"I came home by ambulance.
"
p271_202,"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
"
p271_203,"It opened last month.
"
p271_204,"We believe a third party was involved.
"
p271_205,"On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
"
p271_206,"Tommy is not a problem.
"
p271_207,"I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
"
p271_208,"He had suffered a heart attack.
"
p271_209,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p271_210,"We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
"
p271_211,"I don't want to use it.
"
p271_212,"This gives a financial incentive to switch.
"
p271_213,"You have a plan?
"
p271_214,"It had all been arranged.
"
p271_215,"I had decided to quit the show.
"
p271_216,"I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
"
p271_217,"However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
"
p271_218,"I might come back.
"
p271_219,"The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
"
p271_220,"That idea is rubbish.
"
p271_221,"The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
"
p271_222,"But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
"
p271_223,"We could easily be cut again.
"
p271_224,"He seemed to lose his focus.
"
p271_225,"If it doesn't, it doesn't.
"
p271_226,"Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
"
p271_227,"Clearly, the stakes are high.
"
p271_228,"I will win.
"
p271_229,"I am immensely sad.
"
p271_230,"It's not before time.
"
p271_231,"He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
"
p271_232,"Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
"
p271_233,"At the time, he was a living legend.
"
p271_234,"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
"
p271_235,"The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
"
p271_236,"Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
"
p271_237,"We were awful.
"
p271_238,"They tried to give her advice.
"
p271_239,"We are so proud.
"
p271_240,"Half of young people had had contact with the police.
"
p271_241,"He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
"
p271_242,"It's quite nice.
"
p271_243,"Three weeks later, he resigned.
"
p271_244,"On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
"
p271_245,"It would still have been a good film, but very different.
"
p271_246,"Of further privacy, he had no need.
"
p271_247,"I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
"
p271_248,"He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
"
p271_249,"Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
"
p271_250,"It is hard won.
"
p271_251,"We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
"
p271_252,"You can feel at home in China.
"
p271_253,"The scene is about this?
"
p271_254,"The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
"
p271_255,"In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
"
p271_256,"Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
"
p271_257,"The concerns are the same.
"
p271_258,"That could be in place by next year.
"
p271_259,"That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
"
p271_260,"However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
"
p271_261,"Chelsea was a great club.
"
p271_262,"Is that a serious question?
"
p271_263,"This is the first step.
"
p271_264,"However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
"
p271_265,"This court has made an order which has not been observed.
"
p271_266,"Blood samples were taken.
"
p271_267,"We shall rely on human beings.
"
p271_268,"This is a question of Islam.
"
p271_269,"That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
"
p271_270,"You take a risk.
"
p271_271,"He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
"
p271_272,"He was also married with two children.
"
p271_273,"It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
"
p271_274,"The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
"
p271_275,"Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
"
p271_276,"That goes back a long way.
"
p271_277,"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
"
p271_278,"She failed in her action.
"
p271_279,"They seem to get away with it.
"
p271_280,"He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
"
p271_281,"In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
"
p271_282,"Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
"
p271_283,"We are a grandmother.
"
p271_284,"He looked very sharp.
"
p271_285,"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
"
p271_286,"Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
"
p271_287,"You feel very helpless.
"
p271_288,"You've got to have both sides.
"
p271_289,"They have shown a great desire and attitude.
"
p271_290,"It was a virus.
"
p271_291,"She is an expert on medical ethics.
"
p271_292,"It's a record label, not a form of music.
"
p271_293,"The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
"
p271_294,"This is a national crisis.
"
p271_295,"We are not going to forget.
"
p271_296,"No Briton has ever won.
"
p271_297,"He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
"
p271_298,"I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
"
p271_299,"In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
"
p271_300,"Nothing is safe.
"
p271_301,"The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
"
p271_302,"There is no openness.
"
p271_303,"They are wrong.
"
p271_304,"Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
"
p271_305,"This is a war over our home.
"
p271_306,"Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
"
p271_307,"The court had a number of empty seats.
"
p271_308,"The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
"
p271_309,"The plot is minimal.
"
p271_310,"It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
"
p271_311,"There is no excuse.
"
p271_312,"The letters are going out today.
"
p271_313,"The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
"
p271_314,"and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
"
p271_315,"The Premier League has been a huge success.
"
p271_316,"My whole life has changed.
"
p271_317,"We are a peaceful people.
"
p271_318,"The election is total confusion and chaos.
"
p271_319,"Henman has been warned.
"
p271_320,"It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
"
p271_321,"For the moment, our position remains the same.
"
p271_322,"They had a confession.
"
p271_323,"We are in the end game.
"
p271_324,"It will work.
"
p271_325,"It's too horrible to think.
"
p271_326,"They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
"
p271_327,"There was no time scale.
"
p271_328,"But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
"
p271_329,"It is a job creation scheme.
"
p271_330,"Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
"
p271_331,"Relief was beyond belief.
"
p271_332,"Is that an issue?
"
p271_333,"They should take their mobile phones.
"
p271_334,"You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
"
p271_335,"The same things will happen with GM foods.
"
p271_336,"The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
"
p271_337,"Who will do it?
"
p271_338,"That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
"
p271_339,"Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
"
p271_340,"I've got no secret.
"
p271_341,"This is a big advantage.
"
p271_342,"went on sale.
"
p271_343,"Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
"
p271_344,"A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
"
p271_345,"This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
"
p271_346,"A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
"
p271_347,"I got a yellow card.
"
p271_348,"We have big ideas.
"
