p364_001,Please call Stella.
p364_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p364_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p364_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p364_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p364_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p364_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p364_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p364_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p364_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p364_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p364_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p364_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p364_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p364_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p364_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p364_017,Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p364_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p364_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow."
p364_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p364_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p364_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p364_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow."
p364_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p364_025,Is that not pathetic?
p364_026,Our nation has been changed by this event.
p364_027,That would be a big step forward.
p364_028,I love you so very much.
p364_029,"Scotland needs to hear it, too."
p364_030,Prime minister Blair is not that way.
p364_031,But at the moment there isn't the budget.
p364_032,It is not a matter of concern.
p364_033,We're not either of those things.
p364_034,The man has already had too many chances.
p364_035,It shouldn't be a problem.
p364_036,"It was very moving, actually."
p364_037,It isn't a free-for-all.
p364_038,PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines.
p364_039,I was not fit enough and it showed.
p364_040,I thought it was the only way out.
p364_041,We welcome the ministers decision.
p364_042,Since then it has become a tradition.
p364_043,The concept is simple.
p364_044,That is how the Farmer is feeling today.
p364_045,And that's the trouble with this business.
p364_046,So what did he do?
p364_047,We must not give in to bastards.
p364_048,The trial will open today.
p364_049,But it didn't happen.
p364_050,What do you think they said?
p364_051,There will be no disruption in the schools.
p364_053,I can live with that.
p364_054,There is no doubt about that.
p364_055,The president took offence.
p364_056,Our commitment is to move forward.
p364_057,"Partly, it is his own fault."
p364_058,That's where it all started.
p364_059,The family is so happy for him.
p364_060,Why has it taken so long?
p364_061,No-one knows the numbers.
p364_062,You make the choice.
p364_063,"It is not the fault of one man, of course."
p364_064,I knew the script.
p364_065,It's not going to work.
p364_066,He leaves a beat.
p364_067,Perhaps it was her demeanour.
p364_068,I see no need to change.
p364_069,It lasted longer than we thought.
p364_070,They've got more time.
p364_071,They made a huge impression on me.
p364_072,There is no hiding place.
p364_073,A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p364_074,This was a massive result for us.
p364_075,It's not in my nature.
p364_076,You see - this business is a good one.
p364_077,Who is he?
p364_078,Scotland were on Saturday.
p364_079,He wanted to talk to me about it.
p364_081,That would be a big mistake.
p364_082,No-one has spoken to me.
p364_083,His arrival could be the making of them.
p364_084,I was close enough.
p364_085,He dismissed the action.
p364_086,I said How much?
p364_087,I support the stand that they are making.
p364_088,The couple had one daughter.
p364_089,But was it really so big?
p364_090,Nature will not find its own level.
p364_091,I didn't have the choice.
p364_092,But this has already been rejected.
p364_094,They have not seen her for years.
p364_095,It was good to score the goal today.
p364_096,Allison is not convinced.
p364_097,He felt there was no case to answer.
p364_098,This is a one-off.
p364_099,He liked to talk.
p364_100,Lots of others were doing the same.
p364_101,It is still holding good today.
p364_102,This takes the pressure off.
p364_103,Our legal advice is clear.
p364_104,But he has a lifeline.
p364_105,This is a horrible loss.
p364_106,"Long-term, it was the right thing to do."
p364_107,We are not leaving the area.
p364_108,The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
p364_109,Success in Scotland is important.
p364_110,We could do a lot worse.
p364_111,I know the worry over Iraq.
p364_112,The outcome is now in our own hands.
p364_113,It was just great.
p364_114,You are always aware of the injury potential.
p364_115,We don't know what is happening to them.
p364_116,It's an old story.
p364_117,It was an important part of the course.
p364_118,It has been a great success.
p364_119,I will be trying to do better tomorrow.
p364_120,Who will take them after that?
p364_121,It is part of their job.
p364_122,This decision is a victory for common sense.
p364_123,One is too many.
p364_124,What can you say?
p364_125,This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p364_126,The money all appears to be gone.
p364_127,He was extremely ill.
p364_128,"This time, it was not be."
p364_129,They are unable to say anything.
p364_130,The timing is wrong.
p364_131,That's why he is a national treasure.
p364_132,He just attracted people.
p364_133,He will be fine.
p364_134,I love a clever reader.
p364_135,There will be no exceptions to this rule.
p364_136,But he's a very quiet man.
p364_137,Destruction came from within.
p364_138,It's not their fault.
p364_140,It won the match.
p364_141,New investment will be openly tendered.
p364_142,I'd never have called a doctor for myself.
p364_143,It is sponsored by The Herald.
p364_144,I don't entirely buy that.
p364_145,It was the rugby writers dinner in London.
p364_146,The casting of her husband was an accident.
p364_147,I would say so.
p364_148,I've had six days of rehearsal.
p364_149,It's a good story.
p364_150,Do not listen to them.
p364_151,It was too soon.
p364_152,It is an absolute disgrace.
p364_153,I don't think it is the case.
p364_154,Everyone would have been happy.
p364_155,It has paid off.
p364_156,Ferguson had done his homework.
p364_157,He deserved that much.
p364_158,We want to know about the policy.
p364_159,Mr Blair defended his wife.
p364_160,He has gone back to school.
p364_161,It is not illegal.
p364_162,I don't know where it went.
p364_163,There was nothing anyone could do.
p364_164,I don't want to use the term.
p364_165,I really feel sorry for the Irish.
p364_166,Now they have to do something about it.
p364_167,The post will be unpaid.
p364_168,One-third of the places are already taken.
p364_169,I hope that doesn't happen.
p364_170,It's all happening at a local level.
p364_171,You will never replace the child.
p364_172,We must do that.
p364_173,England will be under a lot of pressure.
p364_174,This has been fantastic.
p364_175,I'm delighted for the lads.
p364_176,I learned that only yesterday.
p364_177,It's very very frustrating.
p364_178,We want him to continue that way.
p364_179,But he did not rule out further talks.
p364_180,Our children are our future.
p364_181,It's part of your life.
p364_182,We will see how he is.
p364_183,He had a horror.
p364_184,So it was in politics.
p364_185,There are two offerings from Scotland.
p364_187,The matter has been reported to the police.
p364_188,We are at war.
p364_189,We do know the reaction of the SAC.
p364_190,The state is controlled by the left.
p364_191,The principle is quite clear.
p364_192,"Despite that, it was a great day for me."
p364_193,I would say the risk is very small.
p364_194,And there are different perspectives.
p364_195,Mr Wallace was unimpressed.
p364_196,I put the drawing down.
p364_197,The hearing continues today.
p364_198,You would be wrong.
p364_199,"On recent evidence, he will not be missed."
p364_200,Police have refused to name the couple involved.
p364_201,Our destiny is in our own hands.
p364_202,The attitude was good today.
p364_203,I've got nothing to say.
p364_204,It requires a wider team.
p364_205,It is so beautiful.
p364_206,It is suitable and sensible.
p364_207,In many ways it was disastrous.
p364_208,"I am really, really happy."
p364_209,This is perfectly legal.
p364_210,I'm not interested in money.
p364_211,I'm looking forward to racing Donovan.
p364_212,I can handle the pace.
p364_213,I am happy to be here.
p364_214,We are seeking a meeting with the Minister.
p364_215,I believe it would have been successful.
p364_216,It's better to be happy.
p364_217,"It's happened, but it's a dream."
p364_218,I had a son.
p364_219,"It was very, very frightening."
p364_220,That suggests that out fitness is good.
p364_221,I had no choice.
p364_222,What do you do.
p364_223,It would also delay the Scottish results.
p364_224,This one would have been.
p364_225,We just have to improve.
p364_226,It hasn't worked out that way.
p364_227,This is very good news.
p364_228,Is it a warning to parents?
p364_229,Everything is surrounded by confusion.
p364_230,There is nothing wrong with that.
p364_231,I could not believe the results.
p364_232,What do you do?
p364_233,"And there are some interesting conductors, too."
p364_234,It was all over for us then.
p364_235,They were assured that it would.
p364_236,Thankfully they liked it.
p364_237,I am very encouraged by this poll.
p364_238,We just do not do it.
p364_239,It was a long time coming.
p364_240,It had happened to him.
p364_241,That is our business.
p364_242,We were completely outplayed.
p364_243,The car driver was not injured.
p364_244,It was a surprising decision.
p364_245,Colin Cameron was excellent.
p364_246,I believe in having difficult times.
p364_247,Stand by for action.
p364_248,It was something special.
p364_249,He deserves a top team.
p364_250,We just need the Government to act.
p364_251,It was really surprising.
p364_252,It was a nightmare.
p364_253,But this is just the first step.
p364_254,We can do it.
p364_255,This is as bad as it gets.
p364_256,The real issue is personal.
p364_257,That can happen so easily.
p364_258,We deserved to get the victory today.
p364_259,That's the last thing he will do.
p364_260,"FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain."
p364_261,It does not take much.
p364_262,It would be a bonus for this game.
p364_263,I've seen it work already.
p364_264,Do you mean today?
p364_265,Israeli forces denied the claim.
p364_266,This could be the case.
p364_267,We try to keep it right.
p364_268,I have got to keep the lid on.
p364_269,Or so we thought.
p364_270,"For many, it had become a fact of life."
p364_271,Last season was very hard for me.
p364_272,It was a definite penalty.
p364_273,It's great fun to get to act.
p364_274,We are keen to have him back.
p364_275,Horses have some sense.
p364_276,It goes in cycles.
p364_277,"And now he has decided, enough."
p364_278,Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.
p364_279,He made no comment.
p364_280,We have to get on with it.
p364_281,"He was at the game, and he is indeed."
p364_282,It would be dangerous to resign.
p364_283,It is a victory to that extent.
p364_284,"Clearly, the future remains uncertain."
p364_285,I certainly hope so.
p364_286,She died later on Monday.
p364_287,It does and it doesn't.
p364_288,"It will not be today, though."
p364_289,We suspect he was pleased.
p364_290,I have been here for only three months.
p364_291,We have no knowledge of this.
p364_292,I was the willing journeyman.
p364_293,I know we ask a lot of you.
p364_294,When he got up he was hit again.
p364_297,It was just one man.
p364_298,It's going to be tough.
p364_299,"You will be very, very welcome."
p364_300,I really want to win in Glasgow.
p364_301,Is he any good?
p364_302,The proposals have been taken out of context.
p364_303,It was then that Rangers scored.
p364_304,This was repeated the second time.
p364_305,I chose the former.
p364_306,"Sub Not Used, McKee."
p364_308,They were very responsive.
p364_309,We're talking to him.
