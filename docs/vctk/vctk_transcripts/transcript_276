p276_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  
"
p276_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  
"
p276_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  
"
p276_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. 
"
p276_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
"
p276_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
"
p276_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. 
"
p276_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. 
"
p276_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. 
"
p276_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. 
"
p276_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. 
"
p276_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. 
"
p276_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. 
"
p276_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. 
"
p276_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. 
"
p276_017,"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. 
"
p276_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. 
"
p276_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. 
"
p276_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. 
"
p276_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
"
p276_022,"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
"
p276_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
"
p276_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
"
p276_025,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
"
p276_026,"How are you, sir ?
"
p276_027,"So is that it, then ?
"
p276_028,"Do I have a favourite ?
"
p276_029,"What do we do ?
"
p276_030,"They might have asked, for goodness sake.
"
p276_031,"Smoking is also very important.
"
p276_032,"We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
"
p276_033,"Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
"
p276_034,"He said police inquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism.
"
p276_035,"There was a rush of water.
"
p276_036,"A fiver and I'll tell.
"
p276_037,"We speak about the performance.
"
p276_038,"She is employed on short-term contracts.
"
p276_039,"Further management changes are planned.
"
p276_040,"I can feel the sound inside.

"
p276_043,"I might well have done so already.
"
p276_044,"This is slightly negative for inflation.
"
p276_045,"And they had a case.
"
p276_046,"We believe a third party was involved.
"
p276_047,"Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
"
p276_048,"It carried a double message.
"
p276_049,"Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
"
p276_050,"But not a penny has been paid.
"
p276_051,"Perhaps it is eyeing a mortgage bank.
"
p276_052,"You must always attempt to raise the bar.
"
p276_053,"The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
"
p276_054,"Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
"
p276_055,"This represents a tough game for us.
"
p276_056,"They have shown a great desire and attitude.
"
p276_057,"Among them are many criminals.
"
p276_058,"And they removed a Borderer.
"
p276_059,"He is too weak to move.
"
p276_060,"Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
"
p276_061,"They desperately want some stability.
"
p276_062,"Everything is possible in football.
"
p276_063,"We like being the underdogs.
"
p276_064,"He looks like an Afghan.
"
p276_065,"This trend is likely to strengthen.
"
p276_066,"He will need that machine.
"
p276_067,"Then they scored two goals to win.
"

"
p276_069,"Pulled a huge number of viewers.
"
p276_070,"The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
"
p276_071,"Let's not be too despondent.
"
p276_072,"There was no safety net.
"
p276_073,"The Government does not go far enough.
"
p276_074,"He phoned the number in the brochure.
"
p276_075,"A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
"
p276_076,"He confirmed that the document was valid.
"
p276_077,"The wingers must have felt the cold.
"
p276_078,"In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
"
p276_079,"I have made that offer.
"
p276_080,"Why do it otherwise ?
"
p276_081,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
"
p276_082,"So, did she meet him ?
"
p276_083,"So what is the campaign about ?
"
p276_084,"The new deal will now be put to the officers.
"
p276_085,"Carlton also declined to comment last night.
"
p276_086,"But the organisers refused to worry.

p276_087,"Webster was brought up in Glasgow.

p276_092,"Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.

"
p276_095,"He's not getting into any games.
"
p276_096,"The coach is a man who is very ambitious.
"
p276_097,"We are talking about the outskirts of London.
"
p276_098,"It was exactly four months away.
"
p276_099,"This is equally relevant to the landowner.
"
p276_100,"THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
"
p276_101,"We are satisfied with this outcome.
"
p276_102,"Robin Williams is very subdued.
"
p276_103,"It wasn't possible to relax.
"
p276_104,"Context is also very important.

"
p276_109,"Even the one she loved.
"
p276_110,"Talk of a crisis is absurd.
"
p276_111,"He's been active in Arabia.
"
p276_112,"England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
"
p276_113,"Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
"
p276_114,"It is sometimes like that.
"
p276_115,"He was unprepared for this fight.
"
p276_116,"I've had it for the exams.
"
p276_117,"Those people must be accountable.
"
p276_118,"If they liked it then I'll be happy.
"
p276_119,"It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
"
p276_120,"Choice is a good thing.
"
p276_121,"I am not very pleased.
"
p276_122,"New Zealand rugby is totally different.
"
p276_123,"Petrol prices were widely blamed.
"
p276_124,"Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
"
p276_125,"Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
"
p276_126,"Many others are subjected to violence by men.
"
p276_127,"Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.

"
p276_132,"The Queen Mother is dead.
"
p276_133,"No one person or small group could be singled out.
"
p276_134,"The excitement could hardly be contained.
"
p276_135,"Margins are also in retreat.
"
p276_136,"Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
"
p276_137,"He had missed a penalty against the English.
"
p276_138,"The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
"
p276_139,"I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
"

"
p276_141,"Cutting ticket prices would certainly help.
"
p276_142,"We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
"
p276_143,"Absences should be carefully monitored.
"
p276_144,"Four meetings have previously been arranged.
"
p276_145,"The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
"
p276_146,"Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
"
p276_147,"We just have to adapt.
"
p276_148,"Are you from the rugby ?
"
p276_149,"What happened in that game ?
"
p276_150,"Are you going to win ?
"
p276_151,"Was it the wife ?
"
p276_152,"Why change it ?
"
p276_153,"And they all have a vote.
"
p276_154,"But they must believe in themselves.
"
p276_155,"Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
"
p276_156,"Token gestures of tiny tax cuts will not do.
"
p276_157,"We made a world record together.
"
p276_158,"This is the logic of punishment assaults.
"
p276_159,"But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
"
p276_160,"That was the first time I worked with Richard.
"
p276_161,"They said so that I would look good in uniform.
"
p276_162,"A good actor doesn't think.
"
p276_163,"That's what happened against Ayr.
"
p276_164,"Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
"
p276_165,"He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
"
p276_166,"It is a good lifestyle.
"
p276_167,"Before the game we went for a pint.
"
p276_168,"City sentiment is in his favour.
"
p276_169,"His job was not advertised.
"
p276_170,"Nato has left them with no other option.
"
p276_171,"Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.

p276_172,"He was just like a godfather to it.
"
p276_173,"While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
"
p276_174,"Yet the survey has been cautious.
"
p276_175,"These people are now following their own Unison agenda.
"
p276_176,"It took five months to repair the damage.
"
p276_177,"They exist in name alone.
"
p276_178,"Advice and counselling will be offered.
"
p276_179,"You had better believe it.
"
p276_180,"It was a sobering experience.
"
p276_181,"I can see it now.
"
p276_182,"There's still plenty time left.
"
p276_183,"Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
"
p276_184,"I've no idea how it works.
"
p276_185,"The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
"
p276_186,"The festivals will be about having fun.
"
p276_187,"This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
"
p276_188,"She is in good spirits.
"
p276_189,"The changes took effect from June.
"
p276_190,"As if that is an achievement.
"
p276_191,"That will be the sweetness.
"
p276_192,"Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
"
p276_193,"Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
"
p276_194,"There was a fossil on screen.
"
p276_195,"The protest will go ahead as planned.
"
p276_196,"I did not concentrate on my performance.
"
p276_197,"The feedback from them has been fantastic.
"
p276_198,"That admission is not surprising.
"
p276_199,"But he rejected calls for a public register of paedophiles.
"
p276_200,"However, the problem is the timing.
"
p276_201,"Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
"
p276_202,"That was just one night.
"
p276_203,"This is a frightening development.
"
p276_204,"They keep the atmosphere in mind.
"
p276_205,"Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
"
p276_206,"Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
"
p276_207,"That is an entirely unacceptable position.
"
p276_208,"My father died in childbirth.
"
p276_209,"It is quite a thing to watch.
"
p276_210,"This should begin in October.
"
p276_211,"Twaddle is a case in point.
"
p276_212,"The Yugoslav army will still be there.
"
p276_213,"Some promoters made insulting offers.
"
p276_214,"We did what we had to do.
"
p276_215,"The squad is too small.
"
p276_216,"What do we want to do that for ?
"
p276_217,"Does the name matter ?
"
p276_218,"how do you get it back ?
"
p276_219,"What are you not good at ?
"
p276_220,"I think, therefore I am ?
"
p276_221,"You've got to be vigilant.
"
p276_222,"I learned that only yesterday.
"
p276_223,"It's been a humbling year.
"
p276_224,"Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.

"
p276_227,"My daughter is an adult.
"
p276_228,"I would not say that.
"
p276_229,"There was a fine line to tread.
"
p276_230,"The refund is fully justified.
"
p276_231,"I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
"
p276_232,"I never wanted a legal battle.
"
p276_233,"It would make a lot of sense.
"
p276_234,"It was started almost by accident.
"
p276_235,"The partnership was set up during the summer.
"
p276_236,"Bottling is now the core business.
"
p276_237,"She died at her home.
"
p276_238,"Had this been common practice ?
"
p276_239,"What do they want us to do ?
"
p276_240,"Is it worth it ?
"
p276_241,"Does it matter ?
"
p276_242,"How do you take them away ?
"
p276_243,"Frankly, it was worth the booking.
"
p276_244,"People have been wonderful beyond belief.
"
p276_245,"We were right to be afraid.
"
p276_247,"That group reported just before Christmas.
"
p276_248,"Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
"
p276_249,"Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
"
p276_250,"I COULD tell that Alastair Wilkie was energised.
"
p276_251,"That view has not altered.
"
p276_252,"No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
"
p276_253,"For business, the benefits will be enormous.
"
p276_254,"The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
"
p276_255,"Five years later, the deception continued.
"
p276_256,"Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
"
p276_257,"Crucially, though, United were still alive.
"
p276_258,"I felt we deserved the three points.
"
p276_259,"Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
"
p276_260,"They've got some extremely good players.

p276_266,"One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
"
p276_267,"The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.

p276_268,"We will turn the corner.
"
p276_269,"Of course, it is a tough assignment.
"
p276_270,"My Dad is a hero.
"
p276_271,"And they were being paid ?
"
p276_272,"was everything done to save people ?
"
p276_273,"What was the matter for concern ?
"
p276_274,"Do I think about them often ?
"
p276_275,"Is it in the right place ?
"
p276_276,"Did he trip ?
"
p276_277,"This wasn't just a big crowd.
"
p276_278,"It was a terrible combination of factors.
"
p276_279,"This is absolutely not true.
"
p276_280,"This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
"
p276_281,"They should stop the bombing.
"
p276_282,"Sunday's game against Celtic is huge.
"
p276_283,"I've come here for the jersey.
"
p276_284,"The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
"
p276_285,"The strong performance is expected to continue.
"
p276_286,"Their extinction is not inevitable.
"
p276_287,"It's never great to finish second.
"
p276_288,"And, finally, I have good news for the songbirds of Glasgow.
"
p276_289,"It's as eventful as it is momentous.
"
p276_290,"We have a budget in March.
"
p276_291,"Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
"
p276_292,"However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
"
p276_293,"That would open the gates of hell.
"
p276_294,"Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
"
p276_295,"We've made a couple of albums.

p276_297,"We have to keep our clients.
"
p276_298,"Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
"
p276_299,"First, the programme was unbalanced.
"
p276_300,"Everything else is a bonus.
"
p276_301,"This championship is different from the other majors.
"
p276_302,"At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
"
p276_303,"Harrowing is easy, after all.
"
p276_304,"Each case is treated on merit.
"
p276_305,"A winter of discontent awaits.
"
p276_306,"They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
"
p276_307,"I am astonished at attack.
"
p276_308,"Says the Duke of York.
"
p276_309,"Our destiny is in our own hands.
"
p276_310,"Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
"
p276_311,"Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
"
p276_312,"She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
"
p276_313,"We've had great things in the past.
"
p276_314,"It could be done by experts and lawyers.
"
p276_315,"It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
"
p276_316,"It has been recorded twice.
"
p276_317,"Aberdeen had little to offer.
"
p276_318,"It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
"
p276_319,"I'm interested in interesting work.
"
p276_320,"We represent a wide range of society.
"
p276_321,"It caused a lot of upset.
"
p276_322,"I saw them last week.
"
p276_323,"Does that put pressure on us ?
"
p276_324,"Did it work ?
"
p276_325,"Do you think we are a top nation ?
"
p276_326,"Is our children learning ?
"
p276_327,"How independent is that ?
"
p276_328,"What form did that take ?
"
p276_329,"Are they free ?
"
p276_330,"Friday night was a pretty good night.
"
p276_331,"This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
"
p276_332,"You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
"
p276_333,"We are trying to clarify the issues.
"
p276_334,"I was inspired by two things.
"
p276_335,"The Government has completely lost control of GM crops.

p276_338,"That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
"
p276_339,"Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
"
p276_340,"Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
"
p276_341,"Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
"
p276_342,"The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
"
p276_343,"And we have the experience.
"
p276_344,"The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
"
p276_345,"This included a downward revision in the expected level of dividend.
"

p276_348,"They would be supported by visiting specialists.
"
p276_349,"You have caught a serial killer.
"
p276_350,"I won't make an official complaint.
"
p276_351,"It was worth a photograph.
"
p276_352,"I grew up with that in the amateur game.
"
p276_353,"The move follows a review of the Singapore

p276_354,"They make a selective perception process.
"
p276_355,"Employees may be taken on at Livingston.
"
p276_356,"There is no quick fix.
"
p276_357,"What are they for ?
"
p276_358,"Is there a waiting list ?
"
