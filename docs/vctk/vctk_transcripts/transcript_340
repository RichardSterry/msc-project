p340_001,Please call Stella.
p340_002,Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p340_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob."
p340_004,We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p340_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station."
p340_006,"When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow."
p340_007,The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p340_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."
p340_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end."
p340_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it."
p340_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
p340_012,Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p340_013,Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p340_014,To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p340_015,The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p340_016,The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p340_017,Others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.
p340_018,Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p340_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows."
p340_020,Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p340_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases."
p340_022,The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p340_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
p340_025,It would be nice.
p340_026,We are not prepared to do that.
p340_027,We've just decided to do something about it.
p340_028,It's a horrific incident.
p340_029,But it's not just about that.
p340_030,We've not won anything yet.
p340_031,He was very close.
p340_032,But someone has to take them.
p340_033,We don't find any danger from them.
p340_034,Do you think they would do any better?
p340_035,"They were appalling, disgraceful."
p340_036,Who was that?
p340_037,"There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!"
p340_038,This is my personal assessment.
p340_039,It is a recipe for success.
p340_040,You've got to have everything inside with you.
p340_041,We didn't deserve to win.
p340_042,This is great news.
p340_043,We can hardly talk about it.
p340_044,That was a month ago.
p340_045,I have lost all confidence.
p340_046,It would be another reason to live.
p340_047,I felt under a lot of pressure.
p340_048,None of the pieces was commissioned.
p340_049,It is somewhere to be.
p340_050,But it was no problem.
p340_051,This has been a difficult time for me.
p340_052,These people are not big names.
p340_053,Don't you believe it.
p340_054,I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
p340_055,We did something about it.
p340_056,Where is the money coming from?
p340_057,It needs a rethink.
p340_058,Why does it work?
p340_059,He would have been wrong.
p340_060,"He played really, really well."
p340_061,He was right of course.
p340_062,It's there for people to look at.
p340_063,"Together, we can make a difference."
p340_064,"That, however, was the exception."
p340_065,This has been a long process.
p340_066,"It's a lovely, lovely film."
p340_067,It's probably just as well.
p340_068,It is time for the talking to stop.
p340_069,We were very close.
p340_070,If only it were so.
p340_071,They do not deliver.
p340_072,"However, that is just for starters."
p340_073,This can be extreme.
p340_074,I'm sure that they will learn.
p340_075,Would she remember the music?
p340_076,There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p340_077,Two options are being proposed.
p340_078,Mr Masterton said he was very hopeful.
p340_079,He is now back in Britain.
p340_080,There was no commission.
p340_081,There was a vacuum.
p340_082,It is time to be realistic.
p340_083,Everyone in front of me was dead.
p340_084,"Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved."
p340_085,It is a potential danger.
p340_086,I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p340_087,But we never wanted to do that here.
p340_088,There was no hint of scandal.
p340_089,The money will go straight to the headteacher.
p340_090,"He said, we're delighted by the vote."
p340_091,It could be to do with the location.
p340_092,This is a terrible tragedy.
p340_093,The teenager had been missing for six months.
p340_094,I'm delighted to be coming back home.
p340_095,He said he never saw it.
p340_096,It is a matter of clarity.
p340_097,You will never get a conviction.
p340_098,He did not have to stop and think.
p340_099,We deserved to win it.
p340_100,Or did it?
p340_101,It's just not funny!
p340_102,His own excitement is never difficult to detect.
p340_103,He almost admitted as much.
p340_104,So what is the problem?
p340_105,We believe it to be completely without merit.
p340_106,He didn't bother a soul.
p340_107,That was my first reaction.
p340_108,Fishing is a declining industry.
p340_109,"Another man said, It was horrible."
p340_110,That's the way it goes.
p340_111,But we still don't know.
p340_112,Are there any he wants to play?
p340_113,The film is on a tightrope.
p340_114,It was a question of patience.
p340_115,I have never been in anything like that.
p340_116,I have done ever since it was published.
p340_117,We have got to the top.
p340_118,"In fact, they have the opposite effect."
p340_119,"And it worked, so we kept it."
p340_120,The king is delighted by the honour.
p340_121,Johnsen is equally concerned.
p340_122,My body is clearly capable.
p340_123,"Yes, we can beat them."
p340_124,She was not hard done by.
p340_125,They said they were only young men.
p340_126,We are in the end game.
p340_127,This is not the case.
p340_128,There may be some resistance.
p340_129,It is the same old story.
p340_130,You need that freedom in society.
p340_131,It is a strong case.
p340_132,Who do you think will win?
p340_133,I certainly would not accept this decision.
p340_134,That was one very hard game.
p340_135,He said something in his work.
p340_136,I recommend a tour.
p340_137,This research is extremely promising.
p340_138,I was invited to work in Germany.
p340_139,"Weather conditions were good, he added."
p340_140,Don't hold your breath.
p340_141,He was shaking like a leaf.
p340_142,I have a moral dilemma.
p340_143,It looks like a hit.
p340_144,How did he know?
p340_145,He will have to live with his words.
p340_146,Openness is always the best way.
p340_147,It added to the spectacle.
p340_148,They are working very well.
p340_149,And he listens to his artists as well.
p340_150,He is advised that he has done so.
p340_151,"Annika is very, very fit."
p340_152,This is not quite right.
p340_153,It really is tremendous.
p340_154,I've never regretted my decision.
p340_155,This is a recipe for disaster.
p340_156,The wind was coming from all directions.
p340_157,So we started building a home.
p340_158,He was as good as his word.
p340_159,It will not happen overnight.
p340_160,Surely it can't get any worse.
p340_161,He has to learn.
p340_162,"He, too, will return."
p340_163,What then is wrong?
p340_164,My brother is not like that.
p340_165,He was very fit.
p340_166,It was very exciting.
p340_167,It is clear that change is required.
p340_168,They did a very good job.
p340_169,It has been a waste of time.
p340_170,"As far as we're concerned, the matter is closed."
p340_171,He had no previous convictions.
p340_172,It is no more than a shell.
p340_173,And did they have sex?
p340_174,But he was a really nice man.
p340_175,It was very close.
p340_176,It should be scrapped.
p340_177,It gives us hope.
p340_178,We can't determine that clearly.
p340_179,They are just trying to cover up.
p340_180,Are you the man from The Herald?
p340_181,And that's it?
p340_182,I came here this week to work.
p340_183,We are really good friends.
p340_184,But that is not an issue for now.
p340_185,Of course the ending was fantastic.
p340_186,I want to be frank.
p340_187,This was an option from the beginning.
p340_188,Clearly he is keeping in touch.
p340_189,Yet it seemed to work.
p340_190,I think it was just a tragic accident.
p340_191,We haven't been able to go and see.
p340_192,"It works, as well."
p340_193,I can't say anything.
p340_194,I would be interested in another attempt.
p340_195,"However, that is a sizeable if."
p340_196,There is no other way.
p340_197,This was all well and good.
p340_198,This is a disaster for us.
p340_199,What does that mean?
p340_200,This is your life.
p340_201,He has seen the past.
p340_202,He can be beaten.
p340_203,He had been on holiday visiting his grandmother.
p340_204,Why does he do it?
p340_205,That's my daughter acting.
p340_206,They are very clever and very dangerous.
p340_207,It wouldn't matter if he had.
p340_208,We lost out a little bit.
p340_209,Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
p340_210,I had just taken it off.
p340_211,The family baton is handed on.
p340_212,We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p340_213,It was properly reported to us.
p340_214,He was outstanding today - the best player on the park.
p340_215,The seller was not revealed.
p340_216,Everything happened so quickly.
p340_217,How can this be?
p340_218,I am feeling a bit better.
p340_219,Everyone here is heartbroken.
p340_220,"Not so, it seems."
p340_221,He was also a great man.
p340_222,We have no further comment to make.
p340_223,This produces exactly the opposite effect.
p340_224,Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
p340_225,You have to keep it on the fairways.
p340_226,"Sub Not Used, McCormick."
p340_227,"So there, we won."
p340_228,I don't like to fail.
p340_229,I really didn't think he would.
p340_230,He may have a long wait.
p340_231,They have already done that.
p340_232,"Later, a very different story emerged."
p340_233,So it should be.
p340_234,They didn't find any substance.
p340_235,It's hard to say.
p340_236,Her heart was not in it.
p340_237,"After all, he is the King of Scotland."
p340_238,Is there any prospect of this happening?
p340_239,They are now collapsing.
p340_240,He had been surprised by the local reaction.
p340_241,Government funding is not a problem.
p340_242,I'm still an amateur in that sense.
p340_243,We just did not want to believe it.
p340_244,The medal itself is not that important.
p340_245,"I should think so, too."
p340_246,The time for change is now.
p340_247,They deserved to beat us in the replay.
p340_248,Can they be serious?
p340_249,We've got to get this right.
p340_250,The film was great.
p340_251,I'm just enjoying every match.
p340_252,They set up to win the hole.
p340_253,I am not a liar.
p340_254,Let's make this clear.
p340_255,We also hope to meet the men.
p340_256,"It was quite simply, delicious."
p340_257,I can't believe it happened.
p340_258,Thankfully it was cleared up.
p340_259,The game will be at a football stadium.
p340_260,They were his words.
p340_261,Shelter also supports the reform.
p340_262,The attack was totally out of the blue.
p340_263,People were very confused.
p340_264,We've had a lot of adjusting to do.
p340_265,I am very relieved.
p340_266,The people have been really friendly.
p340_267,"It was bound to happen, and it has happened."
p340_268,Aberdeen were difficult to break down.
p340_269,"That, though, is not true."
p340_270,I hope he comes back.
p340_271,They made up for it on Saturday.
p340_272,That was our mission.
p340_273,I am delighted for them.
p340_274,The second half was a different affair.
p340_275,The scheme has been funded by the Government.
p340_276,They might be surprised by the response.
p340_277,I've done it all.
p340_278,We have worked well with them for years.
p340_279,They've had a good start as well.
p340_280,The director's a genius.
p340_281,One thing is clear.
p340_282,We might never see him again.
p340_283,Such as it is.
p340_284,The car was just there.
p340_285,They were very unfair to him.
p340_286,I have spoken to my brother.
p340_287,And that is very good indeed.
p340_288,We could have had no new money.
p340_289,It wasn't an easy decision.
p340_290,It wasn't really like that at all.
p340_291,What will happen to them now?
p340_292,It is set in Paris.
p340_293,The Dream is as hard as they come.
p340_294,We are not collecting.
p340_295,It shows the right amount of progress.
p340_296,I thought the dancing was over.
p340_297,I think they have got it completely right.
p340_298,This is excellent news for Glasgow.
p340_299,He's already made history.
p340_300,Police have appealed for witnesses.
p340_301,There is a lot of fear.
p340_302,They are not left wing.
p340_303,I've heard it all before.
p340_304,We are not there yet.
p340_305,We will not give up on the truth.
p340_306,"Sub Not Used, McCall."
p340_307,Now they had it.
p340_308,She died a few days later.
p340_309,What is their concern?
p340_310,The difference was amazing.
p340_311,That is why we are here.
p340_312,But it is historic.
p340_313,You have to feel for the guy.
p340_314,I have still to hear about that.
p340_315,I'm going to win the next two.
p340_316,You know it was good fun.
p340_317,They want that school.
p340_318,They have not changed at all.
p340_319,"One is investment, one is reform."
p340_320,The last few weeks have been really bad.
p340_321,Structural changes will never be enough.
p340_322,I am extremely cautious.
p340_323,That was always the danger.
p340_324,Will they fall in love?
p340_325,There was nothing sinister in that.
p340_326,But don't just take my word for it.
p340_327,Is that what it's about?
p340_328,And the audience is a surprise.
p340_329,They worked on it for three hours.
p340_330,Let's make him a show.
p340_331,I'd never heard anything like it before.
p340_332,People are using it in their daily lives.
p340_333,It seemed so personal.
p340_334,Would that be for men and women?
p340_335,The government agreed to pay.
p340_336,I think we have got the balance right.
p340_337,It was a very terrible thing.
p340_338,Let's not take too much for granted.
p340_339,It has been an extremely long haul.
p340_340,I'll need to discuss it with my family.
p340_341,She is deeply distressed.
p340_342,They should have listened to me.
p340_343,"Well, there can be no complaints about this one."
p340_344,They said they would.
p340_345,When will this change?
p340_346,You know the score.
p340_347,It was like someone had died.
p340_348,I am an innocent man.
p340_349,The improvement today was fantastic.
p340_350,He has been under great pressure.
p340_351,I'm looking forward to coming home.
p340_352,She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p340_353,Our Great Depression is our lives.
p340_354,He was elected as a councillor last year.
p340_355,I just did not cope with the pressure.
p340_356,But he did not appear.
p340_357,So he was anxious to try something new.
p340_358,The time was right.
p340_359,It all happened so quickly.
p340_360,It is working well.
p340_361,They really want to do it.
p340_362,He said nothing of the sort.
p340_363,Governments will have to respond.
p340_364,It simply doesn't happen.
p340_365,We wanted to do something different.
p340_366,"The past is history, not destiny."
p340_367,I love it here.
p340_368,Things are on track.
p340_369,Frankly it was disgusting.
p340_370,It is a tragedy for the area.
p340_371,He was not entirely correct.
p340_372,I'm sorry if any offence has been caused.
p340_373,War is not the action.
p340_374,There are not enough of them.
p340_375,It has been a frustrating one.
p340_376,"Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things."
p340_377,But we wouldn't want them any other way.
p340_378,What's in a name?
p340_379,It feels like a winner already.
p340_380,They are expected to be released today.
p340_381,There was no question of him not impressing.
p340_382,We were all afraid.
p340_383,I hadn't had that before.
p340_384,We have a plan in place.
p340_385,That is to miss the point.
p340_386,It will be a new experience.
p340_387,I didn't see it.
p340_388,Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p340_389,IT had to happen.
p340_390,It is a challenge for all of us.
p340_391,The children are fine.
p340_392,I don't believe in God.
p340_393,There's also the point.
p340_394,It's good to be back.
p340_395,It wasn't the second one.
p340_396,He got his degree.
p340_397,And rugby fans can help.
p340_398,Detectives are still working on the case.
p340_399,I reported it but nothing was done.
p340_400,They were not defeated.
p340_401,There was much to be positive about.
p340_402,It wants them to go home.
p340_403,I had a ball today.
p340_404,Yet the improvement in behaviour was huge.
p340_405,He said no survivors had been found.
p340_406,It is the end of an era.
p340_407,We shall not do that.
p340_408,"My daughter was really, really innocent."
p340_409,It will not be easy.
p340_410,"Once again, he refused."
p340_411,And it will be a challenge.
p340_412,And Scotland is no different.
p340_413,The power of religion is so strong.
p340_414,It means a huge amount.
p340_415,There are two interests in this woodland.
p340_416,I was frustrated here.
p340_417,It is a good result.
p340_418,Are you watching Liverpool?
p340_419,I'll never think of myself as a star.
p340_420,It was one New Year.
p340_421,We made a world record together.
p340_422,Our policy is already working well.
p340_423,I believe we have a good chance.
p340_424,Things were not easy from the outset.
