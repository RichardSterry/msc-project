p264_001,"Please call Stella.  )
"
p264_002,"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  )
"
p264_003,"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  )
"
p264_004,"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  )
"
p264_005,"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. )
"
p264_006,"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. )
"
p264_007,"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. )
"
p264_008,"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. )
"
p264_009,"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. )
"
p264_010,"People look, but no one ever finds it. )
"
p264_011,"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. )
"
p264_012,"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. )
"
p264_013,"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. )
"
p264_014,"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. )
"
p264_015,"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. )
"
p264_016,"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. )
"
p264_018,"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. )
"
p264_019,"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. )
"
p264_020,"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. )
"
p264_021,"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. )
"
p264_023,"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. )
"
p264_024,"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.)
"
p264_025,"The west coast line is not just for middle England.)
"
p264_026,"I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.)
"
p264_027,"He does not even trust his own members.)
"
p264_028,"We're only taking on a couple just now.)
"
p264_029,"The local primary is excellent.)
"
p264_030,"Do not give your details to anyone.)
"
p264_031,"I feel I did not have enough time.)
"
p264_032,"He added that her comments were noted.)
"
p264_033,"It felt right for me.)
"
p264_034,"We are opening an inquiry.)
"
p264_035,"This remains the case.)
"
p264_036,"Certainly, we do as well.)
"
p264_037,"It carried a double message.)
"
p264_038,"It was a total surprise.)
"
p264_039,"I wish I could see it again.)
"
p264_040,"I am secure in my owns position.)
"
p264_041,"Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.)
"
p264_042,"It is a complex deal.)
"
p264_043,"I made my mind up before we came on tour.)
"
p264_044,"It does not stop here.)
"
p264_045,"We're working on it night and day.)
"
p264_046,"The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.)
"
p264_047,"The results, out tomorrow, will focus on the company's strategy.)
"
p264_048,"There remains some Scottish influence, however.)
"
p264_049,"I only signed this morning.)
"
p264_050,"The Office is a show about nothing, then.)
"
p264_051,"We were leading by two goals.)
"
p264_053,"It was dangerous but vital employment.)
"
p264_054,"All options are available.)
"
p264_055,"How are you, sir?)
"
p264_056,"So is that it, then?)
"
p264_057,"Do I have a favourite?)
"
p264_058,"What do we do?)
"
p264_059,"Why do it otherwise?)
"
p264_060,"What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?)
"
p264_061,"So, did she meet him?)
"
p264_062,"It happens from time to time.)
"
p264_063,"You could very well be.)
"
p264_064,"People come to see the Highlands.)
"
p264_065,"It is nice to be a woman and a wife.)
"
p264_066,"She always put the party first.)
"
p264_067,"Things have just worked out this way.)
"
p264_068,"That is not possible.)
"
p264_069,"This is far too high.)
"
p264_070,"He has real potential.)
"
p264_071,"But I had never been in a theatre.)
"
p264_072,"Without doubt, the debate on education is welcome.)
"
p264_073,"Confidence is as low as it can get.)
"
p264_074,"I think with my experience I can help the team.)
"
p264_075,"That is really all.)
"
p264_076,"The deal was done on Wednesday.)
"
p264_077,"The time has arrived for a review.)
"
p264_078,"That is very important.)
"
p264_079,"Only water is currently allowed.)
"
p264_080,"Put simply, it goes something like this.)
"
p264_081,"Over one million people have been forced from their homes.)
"
p264_082,"It looks that way.)
"
p264_083,"Now comes the hard part.)
"
p264_084,"Maybe they will see sense.)
"
p264_085,"We're at home, which is important.)
"
p264_086,"Because I was a very physical person.)
"
p264_087,"The circumstances have changed since last year.)
"
p264_088,"They're already booked for next year.)
"
p264_089,"The savings can be dramatic.)
"
p264_090,"They would now be able to look forward with confidence.)
"
p264_091,"They are a different team at home.)
"
p264_092,"However this weekend it will be different.)
"
p264_093,"Are you going to win?)
"
p264_094,"What is the wife?)
"
p264_096,"What do we want to do that for?)
"
p264_097,"Does the name matter?)
"
p264_098,"how do you get it back?)
"
p264_099,"What are you not good at?)
"
p264_100,"His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.)
"
p264_101,"Two of our crew were killed.)
"
p264_102,"I feel confident about the outcome.)
"
p264_103,"The referee had been right.)
"
p264_104,"Jack was always going to win this one.)
"
p264_105,"It would be easy to think so.)
"
p264_106,"You're quite wrong, he said.)
"
p264_107,"I was born for this moment.)
"
p264_108,"I first met him last summer.)
"
p264_109,"The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.)
"
p264_110,"You can maintain regular contact.)
"
p264_112,"This makes up for it.)
"
p264_113,"Firm action must be taken.)
"
p264_114,"But they had to be paid for.)
"
p264_115,"That's the bit that's wrong.)
"
p264_116,"Nothing would now surprise me.)
"
p264_117,"Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.)
"
p264_118,"But I am in practice.)
"
p264_119,"Trading is tough at the moment.)
"
p264_120,"It came a bit late.)
"
p264_121,"All music goes into me.)
"
p264_122,"That was a great performance by the team.)
"
p264_123,"It seemed like four hours.)
"
p264_124,"The family moved around a lot.)
"
p264_125,"We beat the Welsh team.)
"
p264_126,"An announcement is expected within a few months.)
"
p264_127,"We have a team to reach the final.)
"
p264_128,"Eight others have followed.)
"
p264_129,"These people were my friends.)
"
p264_130,"That will bring about a dramatic improvement.)
"
p264_131,"It's nice to see a very positive style of football.)
"
p264_132,"This commitment should be built upon.)
"
p264_133,"I hope we've reached the bottom now.)
"
p264_134,"This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.)
"
p264_135,"Domestic orders have also fallen since January.)
"
p264_136,"However, it's possible that Dick can have influence some Dutch players to go there.)
"
p264_137,"This is a separate announcement which is in a different league.)
"
p264_138,"It's very dangerous for markets.)
"
p264_139,"He said some things which were better left alone.)
"
p264_140,"He nearly killed my son.)
"
p264_141,"That comes at a cost.)
"
p264_142,"Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.)
"
p264_143,"I told them during their morning break.)
"
p264_144,"The eye was badly closed on Sunday.)
"
p264_145,"The truth will come out.)
"
p264_146,"Mr Dewar understood that.)
"
p264_147,"She's been shot.)
"
p264_148,"Do I think about them often?)
"
p264_149,"Is it in the right place?)
"
p264_150,"Did he trip?)
"
p264_151,"Does that put pressure on us?)
"
p264_152,"Did it work?)
"
p264_153,"Their moment had come, or so they said.)
"
p264_154,"He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.)
"
p264_155,"The second failed completely.)
"
p264_156,"It gives a commitment.)
"
p264_157,"Now it was Britain's turn.)
"
p264_158,"We have come a long way since then.)
"
p264_159,"Sport is good for you.)
"
p264_160,"It was clearly not a battle.)
"
p264_161,"No such meeting took place.)
"
p264_162,"It is just too tough.)
"
p264_163,"There is no doubt there's room for us.)
"
p264_164,"The options seem limited.)
"
p264_165,"It's been my life.)
"
p264_166,"Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.)
"
p264_167,"We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.)
"
p264_168,"Everything people said about it was true.)
"
p264_169,"I've no idea how it works.)
"
p264_170,"No, but my wife is.)
"
p264_171,"It is a large number.)
"
p264_172,"I'm taking each day as it comes.)
"
p264_173,"Art can challenge our value system.)
"
p264_174,"Now he's back on top again.)
"
p264_176,"No-one wants to talk about death.)
"
p264_177,"Once again, he refused.)
"
p264_178,"We just want this session to end.)
"
p264_179,"You can spend money on housing.)
"
p264_180,"I've never had a year like this.)
"
p264_181,"Neil has worked hard throughout his career.)
"
p264_182,"He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.)
"
p264_183,"We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.)
"
p264_184,"She really suffered for her art.)
"
p264_185,"The single currency could well lead to a single tax policy.)
"
p264_186,"She runs like her mother.)
"
p264_187,"I remember that day well.)
"
p264_188,"In short, the national team without Frank is like football without feet.)
"
p264_189,"They were certainly tough, but totally fair.)
"
p264_190,"The questions came quick and fast.)
"
p264_191,"We tried four banks.)
"
p264_192,"Is there a waiting list?)
"
p264_193,"Do they think anyone else wants them?)
"
p264_194,"So what happens next?)
"
p264_195,"Had this been common practice?)
"
p264_196,"What do they want us to do?)
"
p264_197,"Is it worth it?)
"
p264_198,"Does it matter?)
"
p264_199,"How do you take them away?)
"
p264_200,"At half-time he was presented to both teams.)
"
p264_201,"Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.)
"
p264_202,"I was independent but I am not now.)
"
p264_203,"That first victory made a huge difference to my career.)
"
p264_204,"People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.)
"
p264_205,"I saw people on fire.)
"
p264_206,"This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.)
"
p264_207,"Both leaders were joined by senior party figures.)
"
p264_208,"Her experience is certainly limited.)
"
p264_209,"The labour side has developed in the North area.)
"
p264_210,"He suffered severe head injuries.)
"
p264_211,"He was a home referee.)
"
p264_212,"Brian was last to join.)
"
p264_213,"It was men against boys.)
"
p264_214,"Three hit the target.)
"
p264_215,"That could mean the difference between life and death in action.)
"
p264_216,"Henry should go now.)
"
p264_217,"Now we have fresh hope.)
"
p264_218,"Life is still very tough for them.)
"
p264_219,"It was a piece of art.)
"
p264_221,"Britain will be little affected.)
"
p264_222,"The two companies were not for sale.)
"
p264_223,"IT has been a tough year for Scottish business.)
"
p264_224,"It was all great training.)
"
p264_226,"No partners would lose their jobs.)
"
p264_227,"I was in daily contact.)
"
p264_228,"He talks too much.)
"
p264_230,"Many changes are positive changes.)
"
p264_231,"This is absolutely not true.)
"
p264_232,"Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.)
"
p264_233,"It was a great evening.)
"
p264_234,"However, there is an issue, isn't there?)
"
p264_235,"After the match, do you?)
"
p264_236,"Has the conflict started?)
"
p264_237,"Have I really come to this?)
"
p264_238,"Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?)
"
p264_240,"This is a big game for both of us.)
"
p264_241,"He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.)
"
p264_242,"They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.)
"
p264_243,"Eight months later, he was dead.)
"
p264_244,"The question is whether private investors should follow their example.)
"
p264_245,"I go home only once.)
"
p264_246,"It is based on population rather than need.)
"
p264_247,"Progress, however, is only achieved through hard work and heavy investment.)
"
p264_248,"They were game, but not very good.)
"
p264_249,"I did not vote either way.)
"
p264_250,"We really are a team.)
"
p264_251,"I hit you there.)
"
p264_252,"The pension levels will remain the same.)
"
p264_253,"He is keen to stay in public service.)
"
p264_254,"For that reason cover should not be given.)
"
p264_255,"He felt too close to head office.)
"
p264_256,"We have brought the staff back on board.)
"
p264_257,"We had a right to expect those days were over.)
"
p264_258,"The group's increasing scale will help.)
"
p264_259,"We were looking for a base.)
"
p264_260,"We had a grand view.)
"
p264_261,"Walker declined to put a figure on losses.)
"
p264_262,"They made such decisions in London.)
"
p264_263,"The proposal was rejected.)
"
p264_264,"This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.)
"
p264_265,"Some changes have been achieved at great cost.)
"
p264_266,"Everyone wanted him to win.)
"
p264_267,"I was totally wrong.)
"
p264_268,"I may play with two players up, maybe not.)
"
p264_269,"Others get through it.)
"
p264_270,"I knew him well.)
"
p264_271,"I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.)
"
p264_272,"All films open tomorrow)
"
p264_273,"If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.)
"
p264_274,"The third has yet to be named.)
"
p264_275,"He was called in by the government last year to report on pension reform.)
"
p264_276,"Scots police had been asked to join the search to find him.)
"
p264_277,"People realise we have a job to do.)
"
p264_278,"I'm interested in interesting work.)
"
p264_279,"It would be nice to be involved in another victory.)
"
p264_280,"Sales will begin by the end of October.)
"
p264_281,"He will get his chances.)
"
p264_282,"Friday night was a pretty good night.)
"
p264_283,"She now lives in London.)
"
p264_284,"It's not a small step.)
"
p264_285,"They have the cash and the fire power.)
"
p264_286,"The institute board will take the decision.)
"
p264_287,"He followed the Italian route.)
"
p264_288,"If not, a deal could take many months.)
"
p264_289,"You have made your point.)
"
p264_290,"He died the following year.)
"
p264_291,"We must move on.)
"
p264_292,"It's just an area of water.)
"
p264_293,"Rangers was on the agenda and I am interested.)
"
p264_294,"If so, we want to hear from them.)
"
p264_295,"She doesn't know the half of it.)
"
p264_296,"Perhaps they were right.)
"
p264_297,"Autumn will be a real challenge.)
"
p264_298,"Many events are down on numbers.)
"
p264_299,"He had served his time.)
"
p264_300,"That was around July, August.)
"
p264_301,"The direct effects on trade will be limited.)
"
p264_302,"It changed the very language.)
"
p264_303,"It was finally agreed on Saturday.)
"
p264_304,"I did so, making the positive case for Scottish New Labour.)
"
p264_305,"Only one got through.)
"
p264_306,"He remains a main board director of Royal.)
"
p264_307,"It's not a marketing scheme.)
"
p264_308,"There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.)
"
p264_309,"Five years ago its return was rejected.)
"
p264_310,"He left pretty quickly.)
"
p264_311,"The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.)
"
p264_312,"They might surprise themselves.)
"
p264_313,"It is his speed off the mark that is so impressive.)
"
p264_314,"Hibs are playing with style now.)
"
p264_315,"Such a policy is for long-term strength.)
"
p264_316,"This is extremely positive news.)
"
p264_317,"Other teams moved up too.)
"
p264_318,"I just felt like a dead loss.)
"
p264_319,"Not one person spoke badly.)
"
p264_320,"The performance continues to improve.)
"
p264_321,"We want immediate action.)
"
p264_322,"Our relationship has been very good.)
"
p264_323,"Someone should tell them.)
"
p264_324,"They really had a go at us.)
"
p264_325,"They should try to get tickets.)
"
p264_326,"The change could come as soon as September.)
"
p264_327,"They emerged before the patients left hospital.)
"
p264_328,"He did not say that.)
"
p264_329,"We are a husband and wife team.)
"
p264_330,"I can't get away from it.)
"
p264_331,"He had played very well.)
"
p264_332,"Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.)
"
p264_333,"That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.)
"
p264_334,"I saw one man vote five times.)
"
p264_335,"It's quite crucial for me.)
"
p264_336,"This fact is supported by audience research.)
"
p264_337,"The regional government faces key elections next May.)
"
p264_339,"Time remains to put other candidates forward.)
"
p264_340,"In Great Britain, it has a life of its own.)
"
p264_341,"This deal is a great boost for the Borders.)
"
p264_342,"An opera company needs to have its orchestra.)
"
p264_343,"The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.)
"
p264_344,"I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.)
"
p264_345,"I believe they are dead.)
"
p264_346,"We have no information on Iraq.)
"
p264_347,"We had to approach it the way we feel we can do best.)
"
p264_348,"It looks at public interest issues.)
"
p264_349,"The book is closed.)
"
p264_350,"I would be very keen on a move to Italy.)
"
p264_351,"He is fully fit.)
"
p264_352,"That would concern me lot.)
"
p264_353,"It's clearly a budget.)
"
p264_354,"Both watched her win yesterday.)
"
p264_355,"Her father had died recently.)
"
p264_356,"We accept the new rules.)
"
p264_357,"Neil knows the score.)
"
p264_358,"He could still be President.)
"
p264_359,"It had been introduced over six years.)
"
p264_360,"Blair is very positive at European Councils.)
"
p264_361,"It shows we're not much of a rugby country.)
"
p264_362,"Her body has never been found.)
"
p264_363,"The purchase was widely criticised by both analysts and investors.)
"
p264_364,"They had to have hospital treatment.)
"
p264_365,"I would never even consider it.)
"
p264_366,"Five local people were injured.)
"
p264_367,"It has helped focus attention on junior golf.)
"
p264_368,"We've had some pretty bad times.)
"
p264_369,"That is for white people.)
"
p264_370,"Neither had any other career.)
"
p264_371,"Without rules, the elections could not go ahead, he stressed.)
